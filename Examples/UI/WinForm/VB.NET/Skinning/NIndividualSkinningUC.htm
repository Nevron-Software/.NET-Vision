Since Q4 2007 the Nevron Skinning Logic has been significantly improved. Each INSkinnableControl instance may now be specified a local NSkin instance as well. This allows for flexible and extensible look-and-feel based on more than one (global only) skin. The local skin value has highest priority when determining control's appearance.
