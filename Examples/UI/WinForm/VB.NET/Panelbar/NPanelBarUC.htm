Nevron User Interface 4.0 introduces a custom composite control called NPanelBar. This is a generic band-container control which is extremely useful for storing and organizing large amounts of controls. The control consists of bands, arranged using a complex layout logic. A NBand object has two states - collapsed (only its caption area is visible) and expanded (it occupies the available space of its container). Use NBand.ContainerPanel propety to add controls to it. User definable image, tooltip, text alignment and caption height per band. The example creates one NPanelBar object and provides methods for changing the text alignment and border style of it.
