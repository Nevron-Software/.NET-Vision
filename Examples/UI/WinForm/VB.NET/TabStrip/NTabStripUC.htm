Nevron User Interface 4.0 introduces a new control called TabStrip. This is a generic control which might be used for different purposes. For example Nevron TabControl uses such a control in order to select tab pages. Or the Nevron Docking Panels use such strips to switch among panels. With the help of this control it is a matter of a few lines of code to create tabbed MDI.
