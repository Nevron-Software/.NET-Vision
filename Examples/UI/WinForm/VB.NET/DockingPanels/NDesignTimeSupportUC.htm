Complete design-time support is a main benefitial feature of any component developed under .NET platform. Nevron docking panels now provide rich and intuitive design-time support with the same behaviour experienced as if the form is running at run time. Just drop a NDockManager component on a form and using its verbs add panels on the sides of the form. Nevron NDockManager takes full advantage of the System.CodeDom namespace and provide completely custom code generation of zones and panels.
<p>
The example is created by the Windows Forms Designer and demonstrates the Code Dom serialization provided by the dock manager.

<remarks>
You may have only one dock manager per form. Trying to add second one will throw an exception. Sometimes, due to a bug in the VS Designer Serializer, you may need close the form and restart the Visual Studio for the code to be loaded properly.
