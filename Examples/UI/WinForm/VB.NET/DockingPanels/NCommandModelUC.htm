Since 2006 Q1 release Nevron Docking Panels provide an extensible command model which seemlessly integrate with the framework and allows you to define global tasks and methods and specify keyboard shortcuts form them. The NDockManager exposes a new NDockingFrameworkCommander object which serves as a command manager. It has some predefined commands like NextDocument, NextPanel, CloseDocument, etc. and allows you to register your own custom commands. Each command might be assigned multiple shortcut combinations (like the NextDocument command which is assigned both Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+F6 shortcuts). You may either inherit from the NDockingFrameworkCommand class and override the ExecuteCore method or create a default command and hook to its Executed event.

You may visually edit the keyboard shortcuts by calling the NDockingFrameworkCommander's method ShowKeyboardEditor.
