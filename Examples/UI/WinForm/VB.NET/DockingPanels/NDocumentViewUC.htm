Since 2006 Q1 release Nevron Docking Panels provide a complete document support including 3 different types of document view style, document layout persistency, standard mdi menu merge and much more. Nevron Docking Panels is the only library on the market which provide you with the complete set of document views:
<ul>
	<li>TabbedMdi - bring to you applications the latest Visual Studio tabbed mdi interfaces. Unlimited nesting of tabbed groups. Complete control over the document tabstrips via the DocumentStyle, exposed by the DockManager.
	<li>StandardMdi - Although well designed and much professional looking sometimes the tabbed documents are not the solution you will need. Nevron Docking Panels provides you with multiple document interfaces style found in the standard Windows Form control. Using a well designed object model a document might be easily hosted on either a tabbed mdi view or on a standard one.
	<li>SingleDocument - sometimes an application may need only one document to be opened at a time. In this case you should use the SingleDocument view style.
</ul>
The document model comes with a built-in manager, member of the dock manager, which controls all the document registered with the framework. The DocumentManager exposes lots of events, some of them cancelable which allows you to provide custom application-oriented logic.
<p>
The example adds three documents to the view and hosts a property grid in a dockable panel. Play with the properties of the DocumentStyle, selected in the property grid.
