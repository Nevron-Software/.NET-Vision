Since VS 2005 update Nevron Docking Panels support appearance styles. These are objects which generally contain information about different aspects of visual representation of the framework. All styles are accessible via the DockManager. You also have access to the StyleComposite object which contains all the default styles registered in the framework.
<p>
Following are the currently available styles:
<ul>
	<li>CaptionStyle - controls appearance of panels' captions.
	<li>DockingHintStyle - controls appearance and logic performed when displaying docking hints.
	<li>SplitterStyle - controls appearance of dock zones' splitters.
	<li>TabStyle - controls appearance of the tab trips used to display multiple panels per zone.
</ul>

You may register your own custom styles via the DockManager's StyleComposite object and its AddStyle method.
