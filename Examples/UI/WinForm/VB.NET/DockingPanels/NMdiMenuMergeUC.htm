Since 2006 Q1 release Nevron Docking Panels provide a complete document support. For the StandardMdi view when a document is maximized there should be commands (hosted on a menu bar) which allow for restoring of the window. This feature is implemented via an interface - INMdiMenuTarget one which allows you to even provide your own custom mdi menu merge implementation.
