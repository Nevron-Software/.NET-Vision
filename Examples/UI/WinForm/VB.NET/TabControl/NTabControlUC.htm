Nevron User Interface 4.0 introduces entirely custom TabControl that exposes all the functionality found in the standard WindowsForms one as well as lots of extended features. This is a composite UserControl which stores a collection of NTabPage objects and uses a NTabStrip control to select the desired one. The tab control exposes the customization features of the internal NTabStrip. As it is a INRendererProvider the tabstrip is rendered using its parent tabcontrol palette. The control provides a NTabPageCollection property used to add tab pages. Use it instead of directly adding NTabPage objects to the Controls collection as the control will fire an exception. Support for tabstrip overflow via scroll arrows and page closing via a close button.
