The NPopup is a generic component which "Pops up" on the screen and has a limited life-time - such as menu windows, tooltips, drop-downs, etc. The popup is completely customizable regarding appearance, behavior, animations, even shadows. Introduced is completely innovative placement logic allowing for precise positioning and alignment of the popup - either to a target, custom bounds or the mouse.

<p>
The example creates a NPopup instance, two placement targets (NRadioButton instances) and a property grid to display popup's properties. Customize settings and display the popup using the "Show" button. Select the "Host calculator" check box to see how any control may be hosted on a NPopup instance.

<remarks>
Beware with the EnableHook property. If it is "false" the popup will not be closed automatically upon mouse or keyboard event.
