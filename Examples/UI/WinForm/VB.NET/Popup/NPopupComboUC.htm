The NPopupCombo is a control which may display a NPopup instance in a combo-box like manner. As it is completely generic you may build any configuration - create a NPopupCombo instance, specify its "Popup" property and the control is ready-to-use. When the drop-down button on the right is pressed, the popup will be displayed, aligned with the combo. You may explicitly override the placement by specifying "UseDefaultPlacement" property.

<p>
The examples utilizes a NPopupCombo instance and a NPopup which hosts a NExplorerBar.
