One of the most unique features of our User Interface Library is the ability to display forms with custom non-client metrics and painting. Overcome the limitations of the system default frames and create your own ones. Specify global or local templates or use the embedded modern ones including the famous "Vista Slate" and "Vista Royal". Using complex render logic our custom forms looks smooth, professional and will certainly give your applications out-of-the-box appearance.

The example allows you to play with the properties of the NFrameAppearance template - simply select the "Custom" radio button, change some settings and press the "Show Form" button.
