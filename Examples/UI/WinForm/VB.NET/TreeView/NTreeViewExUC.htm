Since Q3 2007 Release the Nevron UI introduces an entirely custom generic tree-view written from scratch in 100% C# code. The control is capable of displaying 100 000+ nodes with ease and as far as you have virtual memory available the number of nodes has no limitation. Written with attention to the smallest detail, the component provides advanced behavior features like navigation, multiple select, range select, smart checkboxes, etc. as well as completely customizable appearance and rendering extensibility. Professional appearance like indicator column on either left or right side, rich text per tree-view or node bases, super-tip per node, item drag-and-drop, etc. as well as the blazing fast performance distinguish this tree-view from others available on the component market.

The example demonstrates general tree-view control with a property grid on the right exposing its properties.
