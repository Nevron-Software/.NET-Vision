Nevron User Interface introduces vertical and horizontal range sliders. These controls are similar to custom scroll bars with one additional feature to resize their thumbs either by dragging the grippers on the ends of the thumb or by setting its Range property.
The example creates one NUIPanel that hosts one NAnimationSurface control with Image on it. Depending of the selected mode (Shrink or Zoom) the NAnimationSurface control changes its Size and Location within the NUIPanel by moving or resizing the thumbs.
