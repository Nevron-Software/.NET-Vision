Enter the next-generation presentation layer by experiencing our NRichTextLabel component. Ever been impressed from the way you may format texts in HTML and *.rtf files? Our label will allow you to do this in exactly the same way and will definitely give your applications 'out-of-the-box' appearance. The control is a combination of NShadowDecorator, NUIItem and NTextDocument instances which allow you to modify both the filling, border and shadow information and text, image, alignments, etc.

The example creates three labels with customized filling and stroke and formatted text. Almost all of the common HTML tags are supported. You may directly format the text from the designer by setting the "Text" property of the label with the properly HTML-formatted text.
