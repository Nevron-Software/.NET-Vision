The Q4 2007 release of Nevron User Interface for .NET includes powerful new control named NTreeList. The control is based on the NTreeViewEx and adds list-view functionality as well. This combination allows complex data-related tasks like grouping, sorting, binding, etc. to be easily achieved. The control is highly customizable from both appearance and functionality perspective and is extremely fast and optimized in performance and memory consumption.

<p>
The example creates a default NTreeList instance and populates it with sample nodes. Use the property grid on the right to alter the properties of the control in order to examine its functionality.
