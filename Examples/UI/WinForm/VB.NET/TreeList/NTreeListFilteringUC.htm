Each NTreeList column may be assigned a valid NTreeListColumnFilter instance which describes the nodes that are currently visible. Each node which may not pass the Filter(object) method will be hidden. The filtering functionality has no effect if the tree-list is bound to a valid NTreeListData instance.
