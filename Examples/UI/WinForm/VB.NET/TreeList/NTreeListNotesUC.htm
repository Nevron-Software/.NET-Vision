Each NTreeListNode may display notes. Notes are special GUI part of the node and are displayed below the logical area of the sub-items. In order the notes to be displayed the NotesStyle value of the node should be specified accordingly. You may do that at either tree-list level (applied on all nodes) or per node basis. Provides are complete set of properties which control the appearance of the notes.
