The NFileExplorer is a predefined NTreeList which allows for file system browsing. The control uses "Populate on demand" semantic which loads the desired child nodes when a parent node is expanding. The default images, used by the OS, are retreived and displayed by each node. Each file node may be opened using shell execute by either double-clicking it or using the "Enter" key when it is selected.
