The NTreeList component leverages the "pluggable renderer" semantic and allows for completely custom painting of any visual part of the control.

<p>
The example creates and assigns two different renderers - a NTreeListColumnHeaderRenderer and a NTreeListSubItemRenderer - to the sample NTreeList instance. Each renderer overrides certain GUI parts painting to customize the look-and-feel.
