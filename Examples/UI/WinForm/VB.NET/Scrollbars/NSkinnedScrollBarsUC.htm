Being actually window styles rather than separate components the standard scrollbars of controls like tree-view, list-box, etc. are painted intenally by the system and are very hard to customize. Nevron User Interface completely extends these internal scrollbars and makes the overall look-and-feel of those controls more consistent and professional.
