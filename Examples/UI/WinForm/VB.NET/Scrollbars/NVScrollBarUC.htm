Nevron User Interface 4.0 introduces custom scrollbars. These are controls, which expose the same functionality as the standard WindowsForms ones and provide extensible rendering consistent with the core Nevron UI look-and-feel. Both horizontal and vertical scrollbars has a base NScrollBar class and the slight difference is in orientation-specific implementation like thumb moving, rendering, etc. The example creates 4 vertical scrollbars (note the freely controllable size of the control).
