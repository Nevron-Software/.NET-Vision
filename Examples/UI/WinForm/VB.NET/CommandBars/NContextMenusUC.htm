Nevron context menus are entirely custom controls that provide ability for displaying stand-alone menus as a result of an user interaction. Sharing common object model makes it very easy to visualize a NCommand object either on a menu, toolbar or a context menu. The example demonstrates NContextMenu with some commands added to it. Right-click on the example to show the context menu. Note the native support for embedded controls. Play with the palette from the main menu to see different appearances.

<ul class="uiList">
	<li>Unified overall appearance entirely based on pluggable renderers and palettes.
	<li>Context menus share the same object model and appearance found in the NToolbar and NMenuWindow controls. In other words the same command visualization and extensibility might be achieved in the context menus also.
