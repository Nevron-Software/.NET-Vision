Nevron User Interface suite provides a convenient and intelligent way for choosing colors. The predefined NColorButton is very powerful color-selection control which not only allows you to choose among all KnownColors but also to create your own custom colors. The drop-down part of the button displays a generic NColorPane with 143 predefined colors and also an option for selecting more colors from the Nevron Color Picker control.
