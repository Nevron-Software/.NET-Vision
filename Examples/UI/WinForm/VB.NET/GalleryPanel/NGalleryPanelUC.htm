The NGalleryPanel is an item-container control which mimics the Microsoft&reg; Office 2007 galleries. 4 different types of item layout are provided so that the panel may be used as an extended list-box or list-view. Based on the Nevron generic UI element, the NGalleryItem component is highly customizable in each aspect of visual representation, including rich texts, alpha-blended images, custom item size, etc.
