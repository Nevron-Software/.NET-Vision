Nevron User Interface 4.0 introduces a custom control called WaitingBar. This is generally a progress bar with indeterminate period (for example when a lengthy operation is performed and the exact finish time cannot be calculated). It exposes almost the same properties as the standard progress bar as well as some new ones.
