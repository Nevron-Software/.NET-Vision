Since Q4 2006 the "Entry Control" logic has been greatly extended. Instead of creating entry wrapper for every single control in the library you may simply drop a NEntryContainer instance on a Form and specify its EntryControl property. This enables you have virtually any control wrapped, not only the ones that ship with Nevron User Interface. Additional settings like FillBoundingBox, Interactive and LabelControlRelation provide fine tune support for creating visually appealing entry forms.
