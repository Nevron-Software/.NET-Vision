Nevron User Interface 4.0 introduces custom comboboxes written entirely from scratch. The main advantage of this control is overcomimg the limitations of standard WindowsForms comboboxes. Things like full control over drop-down part, user-definable border style and appearance and image support per item are now available through Nevron ComboBox component. As the drop-down part is actually a NListBox you have all the new and specific features introduced in it.
