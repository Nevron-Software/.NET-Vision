The NTrackBar is a modern and extended replacement of the standard System.Windows.Forms TrackBar control. Based on the NShadowDecorator component the control simply hosts a generic Nevron.UI.NTrackBarElement and redirects the user input to it. Being completely custom our NTrackBar allows for settings being unavailable in the standard one - thumb size, tick height, padding, action mouse button, etc. The control uses the default colors provided by its palette but you may completely change its fill, stroke and shadow information.
