Nevron User Interface 4.0 introduces custom progress bar. This is entirely custom control written from scratch. The control exposes the same functionality as the standard Windows Forms one but provides great control over the visual appearance. Play with the properties of the control in the example to explore the great level of customization it supports. Change the Palette.PressedDark property to change the color of the progress, Palette.ControlLight to change the back color of the control and Palette.ControlText to change the text color.
