The NCalculator is a NShadowDecorator derivative which visualizes a NCalculatorElement instance. It may perform simple arithmetical operations like Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide. It may also store an additional value, the so called "Memory".

The example creates two NCalculator instances, one with default settings and the other with customized ones.
