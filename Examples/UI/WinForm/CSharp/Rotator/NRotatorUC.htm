The NRotator is a very useful control which brings the popular "Rotator" feature from ASP.NET to your Windows Forms. The control contains a collection of frames where each frame is described by a generic UI element providing complete control over visual appearance, image and text. The well-designed set of properties will enable you with fine-tune control over frame duration, animation speed, animation direction and much more.
