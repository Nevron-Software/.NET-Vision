The Nevron Skinning Manager is a powerful tool which enables you to provide image-based appearance logic to the entire UI. Each UI control is divided into parts and states and each state is described by a skin entry. Each entry contains two NSkinImageShape members - one describing the background and one for an optional glyph. For example a scrollbar arrow uses both members to make its appearance.
<p>
The example initializes the two predefined skins that ship with Nevron User Interface - "Vista" and "MacOS". Select a skin from the drop-down combo or enable/disable the skinning manager from the checkbox.

<remarks>
The skinning logic has highest priority when defining control's appearance. In order to use the palette-based look-and-feel the skinning manager should be disabled.
