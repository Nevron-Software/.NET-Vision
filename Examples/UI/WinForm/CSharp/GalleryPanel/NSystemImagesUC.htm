The NSystemImages helper class allows you to retreive a specific image used by the system; each image is internally stored in a native image list (two lists are handled - one for small (16,16) images and one for large (32,32) images). The NGalleryPanel is capable of loading and displaying all the images from either the small or the large system image lists.
