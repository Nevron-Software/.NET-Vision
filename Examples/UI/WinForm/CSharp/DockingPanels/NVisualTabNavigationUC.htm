Nevron Docking Panels are the only one Docking Library on the component market which enables you with the advanced CTRL+TAB visual navigation found in Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio 2005. Pressing Ctrl+Tab will bring a NPopup window containing two gallery panels - one containing all active docking panels and one containing all active documents. Optionally this feature may be turned on and off via the VisualTabNavigation property of a NDockManager. You may also change the shortcut which triggers the pop-up.
