The so called "Sticky Windows" - a dragged window will "stick" to some other logical area - is a very nice and useful feature now available in the Nevron Docking Panels. You have complete control over this behaviour - things like whether or not to use sticky windows, sticky area inflate, stick to main form, stick to working area, etc. are all easily customized either at run or design-time. This feature is also available for the document frames when the document view is MdiStandart.
