The tree based layout logic of the panels enables for any complex structure to be achieved in a few lines of code. The layout of each INDockZone object is controlled by a separate class - NDockZoneLayoutEngine. You may create your own layout engines and replace the default ones. Sizing of a INDockZoneChild object is extended by the NSizeInfo class, member of every child. There are three available sizing modes - AutoSize, Relative and Absolute.
<p>Following is a diagram of the tree found in the example:</p>
