Nevron User Interface 4.0 introduces custom drawn up-down controls. They derive from the standard WindowsForms ones and extend the rendering greatly. A very useful extended feature is provided to the NNumericUpDown control - you may specify custom text. It is useful if you want for example display the measurement system you work with - cm, mm, etc.
