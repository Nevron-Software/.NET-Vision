The NTooltipController is a powerful tool which manages all tooltip requests per UI thread. It uses the NTooltipInfo object to create and display a pop-up window which contains brief summary about a control. Visually appealing effects like fade-in and fade-out animations, transparency, shadows, custom background, based on our generic NUIShape primitives, are easily achieved. The differences between the older NTooltip component and the NTooltipController are many, most significant of them being animations, shadows supported on Windows 2000, synchronization in two subsequent tooltip display requests, complete control over tooltip's behavior, placement and appearance, etc.

<p>The example creates two NRichTextLabel instances with their TooltipInfo properties customized. Click on a label to display its TooltipInfo instance in the property grid. When a tooltip is displayed, move the mouse fast over the other label to see the usage and meaning of the BetweenDelay property.</p>
