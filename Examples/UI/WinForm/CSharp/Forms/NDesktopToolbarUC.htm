Nevron User Interface gives you the ability to add the "Desktop Toolbar" functionality to your Windows Forms Applications. When Docked to any edge of the Desktop the Form will behave in much the same way as the Windows Taskbar - it will reserve desktop space, other windows will not overlap it, etc. The user may also detach the Form and it will behave like a standard .NET Form.

<remarks>
The Form must be a tool window in order to behave like a Desktop Toolbar.
