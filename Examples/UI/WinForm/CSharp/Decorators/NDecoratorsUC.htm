Based on the generic Decorator design-pattern our Decorators are extremely useful controls enabling you not only to experience all of the predefined components that ship with the library but to create and decorate your own custom ones with ease. Modern effects like Glass, Gel, Vista are a piece of cake to produce with our decorators. And yet another unique feature is the support for shadow - either solid or linear blur. All fill, stroke and shadow information is grouped by objects so that you can customize the look-and-feel of your application using only the Windows Forms Designer.

The example creates several decorators with default and customized settings. Click on a decorator to see its properties in the property grid on the right.
