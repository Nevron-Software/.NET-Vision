Inspired from the pop notifications available in the MS Office 2003 and MS Messenger our NPopupNotify component enables you to display notifications in much the same manner. Our component is the only one on the market which takes into consideration the edge at which the system TaskBar is docked and properly calculates its location and animation.
Opacity, animation effects, custom shapes, rich text context, "Options" caption button, etc. - all are freely customizable either at run or design-time.
