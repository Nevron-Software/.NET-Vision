Currently the NTreeList supports binding to a DataTable, which is the most common scenario. You create an instance of the NTreeListTableData class, assign it a valid data table and call NTreeListData.Bind(NTreeList) method. The NTreeListData object may be easily extended to support custom data binding.

<p>
The example binds the sample tree-list to a data table, groups by the "Company" column and sorts the "CompanyName" column ascending.
