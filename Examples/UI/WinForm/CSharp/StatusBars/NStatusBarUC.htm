Nevron User Interface 4.0 introduces owner-drawn standard WindowsForms SatusBar. The control is double-buffering painted and highly extensible in any aspect of visual representation. New predefined NStatusBarPanel objects, providing much more customization features than the standard ones. Native support for embeded controls per panel basis. The example creates one status bar docked bottom (this is the default and recommended dock style for this control) and provides methods for creating and adding customized panels to it.
