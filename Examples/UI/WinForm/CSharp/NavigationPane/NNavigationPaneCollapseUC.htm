The Q2 2007 release of Nevron UI for .NET extends the NNavigationPane with the Collapse/Expand feature found in Microsoft&reg; Office 2007. By clicking the button on the caption of the pane you toggle its state. When the pane is collapsed you may display the currently active band by clicking in the area below the caption and above the buttons stack.
