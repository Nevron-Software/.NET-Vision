<description>
The NTreeViewEx has yet another useful feature which allows you to load and view any XML document (file). The hierachical XML data is displayed by nodes where each XmlElement is described by two child nodes - one for all XmlChildNodes and one for all XmlAtributes. The example loads the ExamplesTree.xml embedded resource and displays it using the DisplayXml method.

<remarks>
The "DisplayXml" and "LoadFromXml" have different meanings - the first displays the XML document while the second populates the tree from previously saved state.
