Since Q4 2007 the NTreeViewEx has been enhanced with filtering, sorting and searching functionality. You may apply a valid INFilter instance which describes the visible nodes. Each node that may not pass the INFilter.Filter() method will be hidden.

The example creates two sample INFilter instances and allows for applying them on the sample tree instance.
