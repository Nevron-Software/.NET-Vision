Nevron User Interface 4.0 introduces lots of useful color tools. The example demonstrates these tools which are extremely useful when an application needs to expose custom color selection.
<p>Following is a list with short description of each tool (in the order they appear):
<ol type="1">
	<li>NColorBar - represents a small rectangular control partially filled with color, depending on its current value. Might be horizontal or vertical.
	<li>NLuminanceBar - represents a predefined NColorBar which uses a gradient from white, the specified color, to black and allows for choosing luminance (brightness).
	<li>NColorPool - represents a rectangular area allowing for choosing a color using the mouse (this tool mimics the one found in the standard WindowsForms ColorDialog). User definable hue, saturation and luminance.
	<li>NColorButton - represents a predefined NOptionButton allowing for modal or drop-down color selection.
	<li>NColorComboBox - a predefined NComboBox used to display color values instead of standard items.
	<li>NColorListBox - a predefined NListBox used to display color values instead of standard items.
</ol>
