Nevron User Interface 4.0 introduces flexible and advanced control used to pick a color. It contains four pages - standard (contains a NColorPane tool), web (contains a NColorListBox populated with all the web colors), system (contains a NColorListBox populated with all the system colors) and a custom (contains tools for choosing user-definable color). Hook to the ColorChanged event to listen for a color change; specify the Color to be selected (the picker will automatically select the matching page). Using this control selecting the desired color is as easier as never before.
