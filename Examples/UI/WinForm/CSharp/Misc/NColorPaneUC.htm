Nevron User Interface 4.0 introduces lots of color tools, one of which is a generic pane used to visualize 143 standard colors, found in the color picker of MS Office 2003. The pane is a predefined NCommandPane and all the cells are nothing but predefined NCommand objects. It has lots of customization features as well as control over size of a single cell.
