The example demonstrates the ability of Nevron Command Bars to persist their state. Try saving an existing state (for example from the Docking Toolbars example) and open it via the "File->Load State" command in the toolbar. The persistency manager allows for specifying custom levels of serialization using NCommandBarsState.Flags enumeration. By default the entire state is serialized (including imagelists, ranges, contexts and toolbars with their commands). In order the imagelists to be serialized they should be added to the ImageLists collection of the commandbars manager.
