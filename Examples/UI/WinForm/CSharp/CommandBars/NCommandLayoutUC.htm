Nevron Command Bars provide five types of predefined layout logic that might be applied on command parent:
<ul class="uIList">
	<li>HorizontalSingleRow - Arranges all commands in a single row without wrapping them.
	<li>HorizontalWrapping - Performs horizontal flow layout - if width of the parent is higher or equal to the one of all commands they are arranged in a single row. Otherwise any command that overlaps parent's width is wrapped on a new row.
	<li>VerticalSingleColumn - Arranges all commands in a single column using vertical orientation.
	<li>VerticalWrapping - Performs vertical overflow layout - if height of the parent is higher or equal to the one of all commands they are arranged in a single column. Otherwise any command that overlaps parent's height is wrapped on a new column.
	<li>VerticalMaxWidth - Arranges all commands one beneath previous using horizontal text orientation. Each command are with equal width and this width is the bigger of max command width and parent width.
</ul>
