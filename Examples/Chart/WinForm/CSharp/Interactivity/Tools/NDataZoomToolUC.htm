The example demonstrates how to use the NDataZoomTool tool of the component 
which works with both 2D and 3D charts.<br>
<br>
Press the left mouse button when the mouse is over the chart and drag. When 
you're about to zoom in the selected chart area is painted in blue otherwise it 
will be painted in red.<br>
The "Interactivity Tool" combo allows you to modify the current interactivity 
tool. Note that Trackball will work only with a 3D chart.<br>
The "Sample chart" combo allows you to select the chart (2D or 3D) on which you 
you'll perform data zoom.<br>
When you perform data zoom in 3D mode you can also choose a different set of 
axes (for example Primary Z, Primary Y) from the "Selection axes" combo.<br>
When "Clamp values to ruler" is checked the control will not allow the 
selection area to fall outside the ruler bounds.<br>
When "Zoom out resets axes" is checked the control will reset the axes to their 
original state when a zoom-out is performed.<br>
The "Zoom in Fill Style" and "Zoom out Fill Style" buttons allow you to modify 
the fill style applied to the selection area in zoom in and zoom out mode.<br>
Press the Reset axes button to reset the axes to their original state.
