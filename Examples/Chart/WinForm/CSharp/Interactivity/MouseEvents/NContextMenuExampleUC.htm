Nevron Chart can detect the chart object laying below the mouse cursor 
and return an object (NHitTestResult) containing descriptive information 
about it.<br>
To track a particular mouse event just check it on left side Track mouse 
panel.<br>
The Last mouse event group will show the information relevant to the last 
mouse event generated by the control. You can use this information for various 
purposes like implementing drill down functionality.<br>
The chart type combo allows you to change the current chart type in order to 
see the information generated by the control when you have different series.
