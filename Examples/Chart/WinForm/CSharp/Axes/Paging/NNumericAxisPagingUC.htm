This example demonstrates the numeric paging functionality of the component, which 
lets you show only a part of the chart data.<br/>
You can modify the page size and begin value for the paging and use the scrollbars to navigate through the data.<br>
When you use automatic small change the small change of the scrollbar will change dynamically depending on the current
page size.
