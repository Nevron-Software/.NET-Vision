This example demonstrates the date/time paging functionality of the component, which 
lets you show only a range of date/time values.<br/>
You can modify the page size and begin value for the paging and use the scrollbars to navigate through the data.<br/>
When you use automatic small change the small change of the scrollbar will change dynamically depending on the current
page size. Note that the auto change is computed to reflect the specifics of date time paging - for example when the
date time scale selects a week as a unit of measurement the small change will most likely be either a day, several days 
or a whole week.
