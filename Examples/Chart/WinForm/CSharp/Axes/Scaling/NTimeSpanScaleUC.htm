The example demonstrates the time span scaling features in Nevron Chart. In this example the scale will 
automatically select a time span unit and step in this unit according to the current time span range .<br>
Note that you can enable / disable different time units and the scale will pick the most appropriate 
one depending on its size and time range. When you check the Enable Unit Sensitive Formatting check 
box the scale will also use a time formatting string that is most appropriate for the currently determined
unit of the scale.
