Linear axis scale is primary used for the Y axes of the components, but can
also be applied to the X and Z axes when you want to display a generic 
XY or XYZ scatter.<br/>
<br/>
On the example panel you can choose how the Primary Y axis major are to be generated:<br/>
<ul>
<li>AutoMaxCount - in this mode the number of ticks cannot exceed a certain number. The scale
will automatically generate a step so that it decorates the axis with a number of ticks that is less
than the specified value</li>
<li>AutoMinDistance - in this mode the ticks cannot be closer on the screen than a certain distance. The scale
will automatically generate a step so that the ticks are not closer than the specified distance. This is the default mode.</li>
<li>CustomStep - in this mode you can provide a custom step to be used when generating the axis ticks</li>
<li>CustomSteps - in this mode you can provide a set of custom steps to be used when generating the axis ticks. In this example the custom steps are set to 10, 20.</li>
<li>CustomTicks - in this mode you can provide a set of values to be used for the major ticks. In this example the custom ticks are copied from line series Values collection.</li>
</ul>
