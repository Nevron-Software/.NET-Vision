The example demonstrates how to create a timeline scale using the built-in NRangeTimelineScaleConfigurator.<br />
This type of date/time scale annotates the scale by using several date time units with varying formatting and levels on the axis. It is useful when you want to 
ensure that the user is aware of the specific date time position of the data scaled on the axis.<br />
Press the mouse over the chart and drag in order to select a range. Then a scrollbar will appear on the X axis allowing you to navigete through the data.
On the right side you can can choose to display / hide the levels that build up the scale as well as to generate data that differs in number and time range.
