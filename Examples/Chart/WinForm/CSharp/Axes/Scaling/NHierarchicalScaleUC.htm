The example demonstrates how to create a hierachical scale using the built-in NHierarchicalScaleConfigurator.<br/>
Hierarchical scales are useful when you want to display categorical data, which is grouped in nodes like regional data or date time data (like the sales report shown on this example). <br />
Press the mouse over the chart and drag in order to select a range. Then a scrollbar will appear on the X axis allowing 
you to navigete through the data.<br />
On the right side you can can choose the different types of ticks you can apply on the labels shown by the hierachical scale.<br />
When you check the "Create Separator per Level" check box the levels on the scale will be delimited with a line.
