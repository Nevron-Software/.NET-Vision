<P>
	Logarithmic scaling is primary used for the Y axes of the component when you 
	have to display data which varies in orders of magnitude.<br>
	Use the Logarithm Base control to modify the base of the logarithm.
	<br>
	The label format combo allows you to modify the format string used for the axis 
	labels.</P>
