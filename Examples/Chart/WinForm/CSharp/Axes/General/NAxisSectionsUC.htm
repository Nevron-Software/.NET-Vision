		The example demonstrates the Axis Sections feature of the component. Axis 
		sections allow you to modify the style of major and minor grid lines and ticks as 
		well as the style of the automatically generated labels when they fall in a 
		certain range (defined by the section). This allows you to visually highlight 
		important ranges of data.
