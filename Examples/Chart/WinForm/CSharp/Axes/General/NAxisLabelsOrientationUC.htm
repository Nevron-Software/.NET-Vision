This example demonstrates how to set orientation to the chart axis labels as well as how to enable axis content fitting in 3D. The example 
affects only the labels of the PrimaryX and Depth axes, but the code is applicable for all axis labels 
including titles.<br />
You can use the angle mode combo to select the mode in which labels operate. There are three options:<br />
<ul>
<li>Auto - the angle is automatically computed by the scale (orthogonal to the to the ruler at the point of the label)</li>
<li>Custom - the angle is specified by the user</li>
<li>AutoAndCustom - the angle is first automatically computed and then the custom angle specified by the user is added</li>
</ul>
<br />
To experiment how scale labels orientation works press the left mouse button over the chart and begin to
drag. The chart orientation and rotation will change accordingly and the axis labels will change their 
orientation according to the setttings you have selected.
