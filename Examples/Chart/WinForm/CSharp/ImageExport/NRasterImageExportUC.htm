This example demonstrates the capabilities of the component to 
generate images of different raster graphics formats like Bitmap, 
Png, Jpeg, etc. When you click on one of the export 
buttons a file of the respective format is saved in the 
application's startup directory. The file is then opened with 
the default viewer for the selected image type.
