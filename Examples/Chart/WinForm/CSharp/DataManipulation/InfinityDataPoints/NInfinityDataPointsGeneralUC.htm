This example demonstrates the Infinity Data Points feature for series with one elevation value like Bar, Line, Area, Smooth Line and Point. Some of the data points are randomly chosen to be plus or minus infinity.

You can control the way infinity data points are processed at data level - an infinity value can be either discarded, replaced by a custom value, or interploted as an average of its neighbour values.

You can also control the way infinity data points are processed at presentation level - they can be skipped, displayed with different appearance styles or just displayed as normal data points.
