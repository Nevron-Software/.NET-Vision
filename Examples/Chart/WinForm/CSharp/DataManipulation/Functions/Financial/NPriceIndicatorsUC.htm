<P>The <STRONG>Median Price</STRONG> indicator is the midpoint of each day's price. 
	This average price is useful when you want a simpler view of prices.</P>
<P>The <STRONG>Typical Price</STRONG> indicator is an average of each day's price. 
	Some investors use the Typical Price rather than the closing price when 
	creating moving average penetration systems.</P>
<P>The <STRONG>Weighted Close</STRONG> indicator is simply an average of each day's 
	price. It gets its name from the fact that extra weight is given to the closing 
	price. When plotting and back-testing moving averages, indicators, trendlines, 
	etc, some investors like the simplicity that a line chart offers. However, line 
	charts that only show the closing price can be misleading since they ignore the 
	high and low price. A Weighted Close chart combines the simplicity of the line 
	chart with the scope of a bar chart, by plotting a single point for each day 
	that includes the high, low, and closing price.</P>
