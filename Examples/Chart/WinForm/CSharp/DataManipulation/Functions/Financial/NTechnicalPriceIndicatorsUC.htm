	<P>The <STRONG>Average True Range</STRONG> is a volatility indicator. It is 
		calculated as Modified Moving Average of the True Range.</P>
	<P><STRONG>Chaikin's Volatility</STRONG> indicator compares the spread between a 
		security's high and low prices. It quantifies volatility as a widening of the 
		range between the high and the low price.</P>
	<P>The <STRONG>Commodity Channel Index (CCI)</STRONG> measures the variation of a 
		security's price from its statistical mean. High values show that prices are 
		unusually high compared to average prices whereas low values indicate that 
		prices are unusually low. Contrary to its name, the CCI can be used effectively 
		on any type of security, not just commodities.</P>
	<P>The <STRONG>Detrended Price Oscillator</STRONG> attempts to eliminate the trend 
		in prices. Detrended prices allow you to more easily identify cycles and 
		overbought/oversold levels.</P>
	<P>The <STRONG>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)</STRONG> is a trend 
		following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving 
		averages of prices. It is calculated by subtracting the value of a 26-day 
		exponential moving average from a 12-day exponential moving average. The MACD 
		proves most effective in wide-swinging trading markets.</P>
	<P>The <STRONG>Mass Index</STRONG> was designed to identify trend reversals by 
		measuring the narrowing and widening of the range between the high and low 
		prices. As this range widens, the Mass Index increases; as the range narrows 
		the Mass Index decreases.</P>
	<P>The <STRONG>Momentum</STRONG> indicator measures the amount that a security's 
		price has changed over a given time span. It can be used as a trend-following 
		oscillator similar to the MACD or as a leading indicator. The formula of the 
		momentum is:</P>
	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Momentum[n] = A1[n] - A1[n - period]</P>
	<P>The <STRONG>Momentum Division</STRONG> function is similar to the Momentum 
		indicator. It calculates the ratio of a value compared to the N-th 
		previous&nbsp;value. The formula is:</P>
	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MomentumDiv[n] = 100 * A1[n] / A1[n - period]</P>
	<P>The <STRONG>Performance</STRONG> indicator displays a security's price 
		performance as a percentage. This is sometimes called a "normalized" chart.</P>
	<P><STRONG>Rate of Change</STRONG> indicator is measuring the rate at which price 
		is changing.</P>
	<P>The <STRONG>RSI</STRONG> is a price-following oscillator that ranges between 0 
		and 100. The formula of the RSI is:</P>
	<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RSI[n] = 100 - (100 / (1 + U[n] / D[n]))</P>
	<P>U[n] - average value of the upward price change for the given period. D[n] - 
		average value of the downward price change for the given period.</P>
	<P><STRONG>Standard Deviation</STRONG> is a statistical measure of volatility. 
		Standard Deviation is typically used as a component of other indicators, rather 
		than as a stand-alone indicator. For example, Bollinger Bands are calculated by 
		adding a security's Standard Deviation to a moving average.</P>
	<P>The <STRONG>Stochastic Oscillator</STRONG> compares where a security's price 
		closed relative to its price range over a given time period. Closing levels 
		that are consistently near the top of the range indicate buying pressure. Those 
		near the bottom of the range indicate selling pressure.</P>
	<P>LL is the current lowest low value for the given time period. HH is the current 
		highest high value for the given time period.</P>
	<P><STRONG>TRIX</STRONG> is a momentum indicator that displays the percent 
		rate-of-change of a triple exponentially smoothed moving average of the 
		security's closing price. It is designed to keep you in trends equal to or 
		shorter than the number of periods you specify.</P>
	<P><STRONG>Williams %R</STRONG> is a momentum indicator that measures 
		overbought/oversold levels. This indicator was developed by Larry Williams.</P>
