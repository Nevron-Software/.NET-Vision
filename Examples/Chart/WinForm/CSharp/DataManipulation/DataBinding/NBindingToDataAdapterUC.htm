<P>The example demonstrates how to bind a chart series to an OleDbDataAdapter. The 
data table on the right side of the control is bound to the data adapter. The 
"Enable Data Binding" check box controls whether the chart will also be bound 
to this data adapter. If "Enable Data Binding" is checked and you modify 
the values in the data grid this will also reflect on the data displayed by the 
chart.</P>
