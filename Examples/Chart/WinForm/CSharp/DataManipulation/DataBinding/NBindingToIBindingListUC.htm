The example demonstrates how to bind a chart series to a custom data source 
that implements the IBindingList interface. 
Two data-binding scenarios are demonstrated: in the first one the data source implements the 
IBindingList interace and contains a list of user defined objects. 
In the second case the custom data source implements the IBindingList and the ITypedList interfaces.
