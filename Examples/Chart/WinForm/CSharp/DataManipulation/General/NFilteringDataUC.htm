Filtering can be very useful if you want to apply some data driven logic in 
your application.<br>
<br>
In this example the items, which are contained in the current filter are 
displayed in red. The indexes of the current filter are displayed in the Current 
Filter edit.<br>
<br>
Reset Filter button - initializes the filter to contain the entire data series<br>
Value edit - specifies the value which should be used in the filtering.<br>
Compare method - specifies the comparison, which must be performed on the data 
series elements. The possible values are:<br>
More - the result will contain the data points, which are bigger than the 
specified value<br>
Less - the result will contain the data points, which are smaller than the 
specified value<br>
Equal - the result will contain the data points, which are equal to the specified 
value<br>
MoreOrEqual - the result will contain the data points, which are bigger or equal 
to the specified value<br>
LessOrEqual - the result will contain the data points, which are smaller or equal 
to the specified value<br>
NotEqual - the result will contain the data points, which are not equal to the 
specified value<br>
<br>
Subset Operation combo - controls the subset operation performed with the previous 
filtering result. Possible values are:<br>
Replace - replaces the previous filter and clears the Operation List<br>
Combine - the current filter is combined with the previous filter (provides the 
means for a logical OR). For example: Give me the indexes of all data points, which 
are (smaller than 40 OR bigger than 60).<br>
Intersect - the current filter is intersected with the previous filter (provides 
the means for a logical AND). For example: Give me the indexes of all data points, 
which are (bigger than 40 AND smaller than 60).<br>
Subtract - the current filter is subtracted from the previous filter. For example: 
Give me the indexes of all data points, which are (bigger than 40 AND ARE NOT equal 
to 50).<br>
<br>
Operation List - shows the executed filtering commands.<br>
<br>
Change Data button - changes the shown data and resets the filter to contain all 
data points.<br>
Extract Subset button - removes all data points, which are not members of the 
current filter.<br>
Remove Subset button - removes all data points, which are members of the current 
filter.
