<description>
The component has built-in data series subset evaluating capabilities.<br>
<br>
The Subset group of controls specifies the subset on which the function 
evaluation must be performed.<br>
Add Index button - adds the index specified in the Index edit.<br>
Remove Index button - removes the index specified in the Index edit.<br>
Add Range button - adds the range of indexes specified from the From and To 
edits<br>
Remove Range button - removes the range of indexes specified from the From and 
To edits<br>
Current Subset - shows the subset of indexes on which the evaluation must be 
performed.<br>
<br>
Function combo - specifies the performed evaluation function. Possible values 
are:<br>
MIN - the result is the min value contained in the subset<br>
MAX - the result is the max value contained in the subset<br>
AVE - the result is the average of the subset<br>
SUM - the result is the total sum of all values contained in the subset<br>
ABSSUM - the result is the absolute sum of all values contained in the subset<br>
FIRST - the result is the value of the first data point contained in the subset<br>
LAST - the result is the value of the last data point contained in the subset<br>
Evaluate - performs the evaluation<br>
Result edit - shows the evaluation result
