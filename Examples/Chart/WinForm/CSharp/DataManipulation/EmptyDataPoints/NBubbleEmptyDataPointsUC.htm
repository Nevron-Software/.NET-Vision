<P>This example demonstrates the Empty Data Points feature for Bubble series. 
Some of the data points are randomly chosen to be 'empty' and 
their values are set to DBNull.Value.</P>
<P>You can control the way empty data points are processed at data 
level - an empty value can be either discarded, replaced by a custom 
value, or interploted as an average of its neighbour values.</P>
<P>You can also control the way empty data points are processed at 
presentation level - they can be skipped, displayed with different 
appearance styles or just displayed as normal data points.</P>
