The example demonstrates how to apply a bevel and emboss filter on 2D objects 
(unique feature).<br>
This filter allows you to combine the original image with two other images 
derived from it but painted in different color (light image and shadow image).<br>
From the <EM>Bevel Type</EM> combo choose the type of the bevel filter to 
apply.<br>
The <EM>Angle</EM> and <EM>Depth</EM> controls modify the displacement between 
the original and derived images before they are combined.<br>
The <EM>Soften</EM> and <EM>Blur type</EM> controls modify the type of blur 
filter applied to the derived images.<br>
You can also control the opacity of the original image as well as the colors of 
the light and shadow images.
