The example demonstrates how to apply a lighting filter on 2D objects (unique 
feature).<br>
From the light source type type choose the type of lighting to emulate. When 
you choose Directional the light source resembles the lighting from light 
sources infinitely far away from the object (like the Sun). When you chose 
Positional the light source resembles the light emitted by light sources close 
to the object (like a light bulp in a room).<br>
The Position parameters allow you to change the light source position.<br>
The <EM>Bevel Depth</EM> and <EM>Blur Type</EM> controls modify the way the 
control builds the bump map used to perform the lighting calculations. Higher 
values for the <EM>Bevel Depth</EM> parameter will slow down the rendering.<br>
