Jittering is a special visual effect that enables you to antialias the whole 
scene. The idea behind it is very simple - the control renders several samples 
of the image each having a small offset in the X and Y direction. These samples 
are then added together to produce the final image. Note that jittering slows 
down the rendering speed.<br>
Check the Enable jittering check box to turn on the jittering.<br>
The Jittering steps combo controls the number of samples.

From the Jittering deviation up down you can control the maximum offset along 
the X and Y direction of the generated samples from the original image.
