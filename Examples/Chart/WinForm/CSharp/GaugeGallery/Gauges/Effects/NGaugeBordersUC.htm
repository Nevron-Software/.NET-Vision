This example demonstrates how to apply border style to gauges.<br />
You can choose the border type from the combo "Border Type" combo on the right. There are three options:<br />
<ul>
<li>Rectangular - applies a standard rectangular border to the gauges.</li>
<li>Rounded Rectangular - applies a standard rounded rectangular border to the gauges. You can use the corner rounding to modify rounding of the rectangle edges.</li>
<li>Auto - the border is applied depending on the gauge type. For radial gauges you can choose from Circle, Cut Circle and Rounded Outline.</li>
</ul>
