		This example demonstrates Stack Floating Bars with custom DateTime 
		positions over the X axis. Stack Float Bar chart is created by stacking 
		one or more Bar series over a FloatBar series. The bars with positive values 
		are stacked on top of the floating bars, while the ones with negative values 
		are stacked under the floating bars. The positions of the bars over the X axis 
		are determined by the X values of the Float Bar series.</P>
