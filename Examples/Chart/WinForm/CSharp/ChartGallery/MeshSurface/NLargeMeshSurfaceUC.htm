The Mesh Surface is optimized for rendering of large surfaces. Using hardware acceleration, the chart can display interactively surfaces 
with more than a million data points on lower-end graphics processors and way more on higher-end GPUs.

This example demonstrates how to configure the chart for best performance when rendering large mesh surfaces. Two exemplary surfaces are used, 
with sizes respectively 500x500 (250'000 data points) and 1024 (1'048'576 data points).
