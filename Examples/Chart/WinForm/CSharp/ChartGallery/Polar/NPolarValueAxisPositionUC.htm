The example demonstrates how to position polar value axes.<br />
You can dock polar value axes to one of the four cartesian zones attached to the polar (Left, Top, Right and Bottom). In this example this is achieved by
checking the "Dock Bottom" and "Dock Left" check boxes for the Red and Green axes that will dock these 
axes to the Bottom and Left zones respectively.<br />
When operating in cross mode you can control the orientation of the axes trought the "Angle" up down.<br />
Check the "Paint Reflection" check box if you want to display the value axis reflection.<br />
The "Begin Angle" up down allows you to control the orientation of the polar.<br />
