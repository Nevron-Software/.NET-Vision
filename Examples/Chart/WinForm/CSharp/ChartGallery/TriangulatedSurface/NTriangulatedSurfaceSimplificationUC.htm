This example demonstrates the clustering feature of the Triangulated Surface. 
With its help the number of rendered points can be decreased by a large amount, 
while at the same time the surface's visual representation is not changed significantly.

You can change the value of the "Distance Factor" numeric up-down to observe the surface in different levels of detail.
Uncheck the "Enable Clustering" check box to see the "original" surface with all data points.
