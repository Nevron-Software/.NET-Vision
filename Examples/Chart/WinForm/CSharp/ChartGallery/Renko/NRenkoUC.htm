Renko charts display series of white and black boxes (bricks) to illustrate 
general price movement and trend reversals. A Renko chart is constructed by 
placing a brick in the next column once the price surpasses the top or bottom of 
the previous brick by a predefined amount. White bricks are used when the 
direction of the trend is up, black bricks are used when the trend is down. All 
bricks are equal in size. This type of chart helps traders to identify key 
support/resistance levels.
