This example demonstrates general Shape Series functionality.<br>
The Shape Series is a versatile series which lets you display different 
shapes with user defined centers and dimensions.<br>
In this example the Shape Style combo controls the shape of all data points.<br>
The Use X Values and Use Z Values check boxes control whether the series should
use automatic or user defined X and Z center coordinates.<br>
When the Different Colors check is checked the shapes are displayed in 
different colors.<br>
The Shapes Fill Style button lets you edit the uniform filling of the shapes.<br>
The <em>Size Limit</em> scrollers control the limit of the largest random value 
generated for the x, y and z sizes respectively.
