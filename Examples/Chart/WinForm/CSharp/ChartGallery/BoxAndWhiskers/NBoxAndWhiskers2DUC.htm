Box and whiskers plots are very helpful in interpreting the distribution of data. Each box and whiskers item 
represents a set of values and displays statistical information for it like minimum, maximum and median 
values, upper and lower quartiles, outliers and optionally a mean value.<br>
This example demonstrates a box and whiskers series that lets you compare the statistical parameters 
of several different data sets.<br>
You can use the controls to modify different properties of the box and whiskers series like box size, 
whiskers size, fill styles, stroke styles, etc.
