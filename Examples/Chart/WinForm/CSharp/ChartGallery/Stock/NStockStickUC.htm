Stick Stock charts are displayed when the CandleStyle property of the Stock 
series is set to Stick.<br>
A stick is considered with up orientation if the open value is smaller than the 
close value - otherwise the stick is considered with down orientation. The Stock 
series automatically paints the sticks in the appropriate color 
(defined by its orientation).<br>
The stroke style of the up and down sticks can be controlled from the Up Stick Line
and Down Stick Line buttons respectively.<br>
You can control the visibility of the Open, Close and High - Low stick segments 
with the help of the Show Open, Show Close and Show High Low checks respectively.
