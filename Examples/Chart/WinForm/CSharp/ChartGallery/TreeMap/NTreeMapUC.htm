Treemaps display hierarchical (tree-structured) data as a set of nested rectangles. Each branch of the tree is represented by NTreeMapGroupNode object which is 
given a rectangle proportional to the aggregate value of its sub nodes. A leaf node's rectangle has an area proportional to its value compared to the total area of all leaf nodes.<br />
Leaf nodes can be colored using a palette or have their own custom colors.
