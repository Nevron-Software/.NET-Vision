Three Line Break charts display a series of vertical boxes ("lines") that are 
based on changes in prices. A new rising line is drawn if the closing price is 
higher than the previous one. A new falling line is drawn if the closing price 
is lower than the previous one. If a rally or a sell-off is powerful enough to 
form several consecutive lines with the same direction, then prices must reverse 
by the extreme price of the last several lines in order to create a new line. 
Usually three consecutive lines are used for the reversal criterion, hence the 
name Three Line Break. As with Kagi, Point and Figure, and Renko charts, Three 
Line Break charts ignore the passage of time.
