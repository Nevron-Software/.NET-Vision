The example demonstrates the ability of the point series to build and update a 2D scatter point cluster. Clustering allows you to visualize massive amounts of data by identifying densely populated regions of data.
On the right you can control varios cluster parameters. <br />
The Cluster Mode combo allows you to enable/disable clustering.<br />
The Distance Factor allows you to control the precision of the cluster. Lower values will result in greater precision at the cost of more points being plotted.<br />
Press the "Add 20, 000 Data Points" or "Add 20, 000 Data Points" buttons to add a new group of random points.<br />
The counter below shows the actual number of points present in the series.<br />
Press the Clear Data Button to clear all points and start over.
