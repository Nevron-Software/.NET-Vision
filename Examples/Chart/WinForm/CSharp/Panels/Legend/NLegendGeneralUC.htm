This example demonstrates basic features of the Nevron Chart integrated legend. 
From the Legend mode combo box you can choose how to feed the data to the 
legend. In Disabled mode the legend will not appear. When you set the legend 
mode to Automatic the legend will present the data according to the displayed 
series. In Manual mode you can feed the data displayed by the legend manually 
by using the Manual marks grid. After you add a mark you can modify its 
properties like mark shape, color and line (which can be very useful when you 
display line charts).<br>
On the right side of the form you can modify the Header and Footer of the 
legend.<br>
The Expand mode combo controls how the legend expands when you add new items - 
when set to "Rows only" the legend will add new rows and will not add new 
columns regardless of how many items you've added. The "Cols only" mode is 
similar except that it will instruct the legend to expand by adding new 
columns.<br>
The "Rows fixed" and "Cols fixed" mode allow you to control the maximum number 
of rows or columns respectively displayed by the legend. When the data items 
are more than the specified limit the legend will add new columns or rows until 
it displays all the data.<br>
The Predefined style combo positions the legend in the control window and sets 
the expand mode to the most appropriate value for the current position. For 
example when you set the style to Bottom the legend will automatically 
configure itself to expand horizontally (by adding columns). You can of course 
later modify the expand mode.
