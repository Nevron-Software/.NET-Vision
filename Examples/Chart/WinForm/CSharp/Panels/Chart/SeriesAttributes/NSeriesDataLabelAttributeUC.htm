Data Labels are texts displayed on data points, which contain information 
regarding the data point.<br>
The information displayed in the labels is specified in string format 
containing tags for each value, which should be displayed.<br>
The data labels are connected to the data points with arrows. You can control the 
arrow length and color.<br>
By default all data labels are displayed with the same data label style, but
you are able to assign individual data label styles for particular data points.
