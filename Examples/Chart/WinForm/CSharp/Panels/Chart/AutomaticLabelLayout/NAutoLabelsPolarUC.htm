<p>
Automatic data label layout is supported by Polar charts.
</p>
<p>
The two stages of the layout (initial positioning and adjustment) can be 
activated or deactivated independently using the respective check boxes.
</p>
<p>
The "Remove Overlapped Label ..." checkbox enables an option which removes from display overlapped labels after the 
initial positioning stage is performed. When this option is enabled the label adjustment stage has little or no 
effect and can be turned off.
</p>
<p>
The "Enable Data Point Safeguard" check enables functionality that protects the series data points from being overlapped by data labels.
The "Safeguard Size" edit box specifies the size of the protected area.
</p>
<p>
You can press the "Generate Data" button to change the chart data and see how the label layout behaves in different situations.
