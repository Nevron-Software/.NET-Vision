This example demonstrates automatic data label layout for a bar chart.
</p>
<p>
The two stages of the layout (initial positioning and adjustment) can be activated or deactivated independently using the respective check boxes.
When initial positioning is enabled you can choose the allowed locations for a data label from the "Proposals for Label Location"
combo box. When "Top" is selected the labels for positive data points are placed above their origin points and the labels for negative 
data points are placed below their origin points. These preferences are not respected only in case the label would fall partially outside the plot bounds.
When "Top-Bottom" is selected the auto label system may choose between the two positions (top and bottom) for each label.
</p>
<p>
You can press the "Generate Data" button to change the chart data and see how the label layout behaves in different situations.
