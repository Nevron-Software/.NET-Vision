The example demonstrates how to create state indicators anchored to radial gauges. In this example the 
speed and rotation indicators are linked with a speed and range state indicators showing whether the 
current values for speed or rotation are in range. When you speed up the car (by moving the scrollbar to the bottom) - 
both state indicators will first turn orange when you're near the red zone on the respective axis and then 
red when the value enters it.
