This example demonstrates how to set the orientation of the gauge axis labels.<br />
You can use the angle mode combo to select the mode in which labels operate. There are three options:<br />
<ul>
<li>Auto - the angle is automatically computed by the scale (orthogonal to the ruler at the point of the label)</li>
<li>Custom - the angle is specified by the user</li>
<li>AutoAndCustom - the angle is first automatically computed and then the custom angle specified by the user is added</li>
</ul>
