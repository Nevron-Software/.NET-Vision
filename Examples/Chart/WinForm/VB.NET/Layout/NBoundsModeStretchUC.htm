BoundsMode.Stretch is suitable for 2D charts because it does not preserve the ratios between 
the chart's width, height and depth. Instead it stretches the chart along X and Y dimensions in order to fill the available area.
Using the sliders you can modify the panel's location and size and see how the chart stretches to fill the panel.
