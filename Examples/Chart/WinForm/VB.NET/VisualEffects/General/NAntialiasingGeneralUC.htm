Nevron Chart for .NET can leverage the OpenGL capabilities to render 
antialiased lines and points. Antialiasing greatly improves the quality of the 
generated chart, because it removes the jagged lines. Note however that it 
slows down the rendering.<br>
Enable antialiasing - turns on and off the antialiasing feature of the control.<br>
Bar style - changes the style of the bar series.<br>
The <EM>Width</EM> and <EM>Depth</EM> scroll bars control the dimensions of the 
bars relative to the chart floor.<br>
<EM>Lights</EM> - turns on and off lighting.
