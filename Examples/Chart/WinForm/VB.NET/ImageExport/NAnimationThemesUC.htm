This example demonstrates how to apply predefined Flash animation themes to charts and gauges.<br />
On the right panel you can control the animation type applied to chart and gauge elements from the Animation Theme Type combo.<br />
The Animations Duration group contains controls allowing you to change the duration of the animation being applied on Axes, Walls, Series and Gauge Indicators.<br />
The Animations Sequence group contains controls allowing you to modify the animation sequence. For example checking "Sequential panels" means that all panels contained within the 
control will be animated one by one sequentially, starting from the panel with lowest Z order.<br />
