The example demonstrates the ability of Nevron Chart to show tooltips or 
change the mouse cursor for the different chart objects. This can be very 
useful when you want to visually prompt the end user that something will 
happen when he or clicks on a particular chart element or when you simply 
want to display some additional information.<br>
You select the chart object that you'll modify from the Chart object combo.<br>
When you check the Enable tooltip change check box you can type the text of 
the tooltip in the Tooltip edit control.<br>
On the right side you can instruct the control to change mouse cursor for the 
current object.
