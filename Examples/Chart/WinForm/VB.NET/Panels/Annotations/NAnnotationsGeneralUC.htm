<description>
Annotations are anchor panels that also posses an anchor (pivot) point. The 
anchor is calculated at runtime and depends on the position of the scene item to which the 
annotation is attached.
<br>
Each scene item has a corresponding anchor object - for example you can use the 
NDataPointAnchor object to attach annotations to chart data points.
<br>
Use the Current annotation combo on the left to select an annotation object. 
The selected annotation object will display its properties in the property 
grid.
