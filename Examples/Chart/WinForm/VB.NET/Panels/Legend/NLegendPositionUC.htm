The example demonstrates the built-in functionality of the integrated legend to 
position itself on an arbitrary place in the control window as well as 
customize the legend appearance like grid lines, fonts etc.<br>
Use the controls in the location group 
to position the legend in the control window. The content alignment combo 
box allows you to select how the legend content will align relative to the 
location.<BR>
When you uncheck the Use Automatic Size check box you can specify 
custom size for the legend - it will scale in order to meet the specified size.
