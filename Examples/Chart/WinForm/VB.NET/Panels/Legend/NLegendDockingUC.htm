This example demonstrates the docking feature of the panels. 
In this example the two charts and the legend are initially hosted in a singe docking panel. 
<p>
The legend docking style is controlled by the Dock Style combo.
</p> 
<p>
The panel to which the legend is docked is controlled by the Dock Panel combo. 
Note that since the charts are also docking panels you can dock the legend to charts.
</p> 
<p>
The Bounds Mode combo controls the way in which the legend determines its size. 
Note that the legend size is also involved in the docking.

<p>
The Legend Fit Alignment combo controls the alignment of the legend 
content relative to the legend docking panel position and dimensions.
</p> 
<p>
The Legend Expand Mode combo controls the expansion strategy of the legend 
(e.g the logic in which legend items are positioned).
