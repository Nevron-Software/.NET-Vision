This example demonstrates several features of the Cartesian chart that ensure 
better visibility and readability for 3D charts that are frequently rotated.
</p>

<p>
When the automatic visibility mode of the chart walls is enabled, chart 
walls are dynamicaly shown and hidden so that the data is never overlapped by a wall.
</p>

<p>
The automatic docking axis anchors dynamically choose appropriate positions for the axes,
depending on the current projection. There are two types of automatic axis anchors:

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Best Visibility</strong> anchors ensure that the axes are displayed on side edges, not in front of 
the data or behind the chart.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Auto Side</strong> anchors position the axes according to the current projection and a user preference for side.
This anchor type is suitable for orthogonal 3D projections.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The light source coordinates can be defined in camera space so that light sources are dynamically 
repositioned as you rotate the chart. In this way the scene is always well lit.
