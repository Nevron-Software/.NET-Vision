This example demonstrates custom painting with the NCustomSeries type. NCustomSeries allows you to create a series 
that displays custom geometry at a specific depth position in relation to the other series in a chart. It also can
report its own content ranges in the X and Y dimensions, so that the chart axes are scaled appropriately.

In this particular example a custom series is created to display an array of points as connected Bezier segments.
