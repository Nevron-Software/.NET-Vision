<p>This example demonstrates some of the capabilities of the Triangulated Surface 
	Series. This charting type can display a set of points with X, Y and 
	Z coordinates as a 3D surface. In contrast to the Mesh Surface chart, 
	the Triangulated Surface doesn't require the points to 
	be ordered in a network. The control creates a triangular 
	network automatically.</p>
<p>The Triangulated Surface supports common surface features like zone palette 
	filling, mesh lines, contour lines, flat mode, smooth shading, texture mapping  etc.</p>
