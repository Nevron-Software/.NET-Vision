	<p>Line Studies are lines and various geometric figures that are plotted in price 
		charts or in indicator charts. They are used as analytical instruments helping 
		to define channels, support and resistance levels, trend changes and to 
		forecast price dynamics.</p>
	<p>This example demonstrates the line studies supported by Nevron Chart for .NET - 
		Fibonacci Arcs, Fibonacci Fans, Fibonacci Retracements, Quadrant Lines, Speed 
		Resistence Lines and Trendline. You can use the "Line Study" combo box to 
		select one of them.</p>
