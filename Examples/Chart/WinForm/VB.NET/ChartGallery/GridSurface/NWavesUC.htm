This examle demonstrates an animated surface chart. Each time you press the 
'Add Wave' button a wave is generated and starts to fluctuate. You can add 
several waves at a time to see how they interfere with each other. Use the 
'Render to window' checkbox to switch to window render mode (hardware 
accelerated).
