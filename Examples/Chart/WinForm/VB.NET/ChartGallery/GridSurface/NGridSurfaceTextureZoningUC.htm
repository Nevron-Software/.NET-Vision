<p>Texture Zoning is a fast method for surface elevation zoning. It produces the same results as the standard zoning mode, but the performance impact is minimal 
(escpecially when hardware acceleration is enabled).</p>
<p>
The only disadvantage of this zoning mode is that it is not applicable for flat surfaces (i.e. when the DrawFlat property is set to true).
