A general demonstration of the capabilities of the Grid Surface Series. Use 
the Frame Style combo to switch between the different frame modes. The Palette 
Frame check defines whether the frame lines are colored uniformly, or with 
palette-defined colors. If the Smooth Palette check is checked the zone colors 
gradate smoothly from one to another. The Filling Transparency scroll controls 
the transparency percent of the surface filling. The example also demonstrates 
the 'flat surface' rendring mode (for contour charts).
