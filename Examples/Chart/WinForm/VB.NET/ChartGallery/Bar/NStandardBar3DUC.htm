This example demonstrates a standard 3D bar chart.<br>
The shape of the bars is controlled from the Bar Style combo.<br>
The Width % and Depth % scrollers control the percentage of the cells 
occupied by the bars.<br>
You can edit the default Bar Fill Style by pressing the "Bar Fill Style" button. 
If you check the Different Fill Styles check box the bars will be displayed in 
different colors.<br>
The "Use Origin" check box controls whether or not the bars should use an origin 
value when they are displayed. If the check box is checked all bars will begin 
from the value specified in the "Origin" edit box. Otherwise the bars will begin 
from the value of the minimum bar.
