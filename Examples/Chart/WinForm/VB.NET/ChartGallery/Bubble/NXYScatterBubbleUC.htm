XY Scatter bubble charts are created by instructing the bubble series 
to use custom x values for the bubble data points. The X Zxis is in numeric scale mode.<br>
From the Bubble Style Combo you can control the shape of the bubbles.<br>
The size of the smallest bubble is controlled by the Min Bubble Size scroll.<br>
The size of the largest bubble is controlled by the Max Bubble Size scroll.<br>
The Change X Values button changes the X values of the bubble series.<br>
The Change Y Values button changes the Y values of the bubble series.<br>
The Change Bubble Size button changes the sizes of the displayed bubbles.<br>
The Equal Size button displays all bubbles with equal size.<br>
When the Inflate Margins check is checked the axes scales are adjusted to fit 
the entire bubble chart.<br>
When the Axes Round To Tick check is checked the left and bottom axes scales 
end on exact tick marks.
