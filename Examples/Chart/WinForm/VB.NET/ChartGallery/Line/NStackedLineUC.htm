This example demonstrates a stacked line chart. The first series MultiLineMode 
is set to Series, while the second and third line series are displayed with 
MultiBarMode set to Stacked or StackedPercent.<br>
Two types of stacking are supported - Stacked and Stacked Percent. The first 
type simply piles the lines on top of each other. The stacked percent style 
displays the contribution of each individual stack to the overall pile sum.<br>
You can change the stacking style from the Stack Style combo.<br>
From the Data Labels combo boxes you can control the information displayed on 
the stack lines data labels.
