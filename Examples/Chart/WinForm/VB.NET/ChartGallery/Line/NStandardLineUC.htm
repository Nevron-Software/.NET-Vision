This example demonstrates a standard line chart.<br>
You can change the style of the line from the Line Style combo. When
set to <em>Line</em> the stroke width is controlled by the Line Width scroll.<br>
When the line style is set to Tape, Tube or Ellipsoid the Line Depth controls 
the depth of the line segments in percents of the floor grid cell depth. In 
this case the Line Width scroll controls the width of the tape or tube border.<br>
When you check the Inflate Margins check the axis scales are adjusted to fit 
the entire chart including the series markers.<br>
The Left Axis Round to tick check controls whether the left axis should 
automatically round its min and max values to end on exact ticks.
