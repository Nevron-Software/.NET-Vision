This example demonstrates how to enable sampling for the line series.<br />
When using sampling the line will ignore settings for markers and data labels and will also automatically resample the data storage depending on the 
size of the chart on the screen. This allows for the visualization of massive amounts of data.<br />
The sample distance scroll bar on the right allows you to modify the sampling distance<br />
Click on the "Add 20, 000 Data Points" or "Add 40, 000 Data Points" to add some more new random data.<br />
The data point counter below shows the current number of data points in thousands.<br />
Press the "Clear Data" button to clear all data points and start over.
