Point and Figure charts display series of columns that are made up of 'X' or 'O' 
signs. A column of X's represents an uptrend, while a column of O's represents a 
downtrend. The charts ignore the time factor and focus on price movements. Point 
and Figure charts are used to identify support levels, resistance levels and 
chart patterns.
