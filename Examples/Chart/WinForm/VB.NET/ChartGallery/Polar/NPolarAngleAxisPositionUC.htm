The example demonstrates how to position polar angle axes.<br />
The example creates two axes - the first one denoting degree values (red) and the second one 
denoting grad values (green). Both axes operate in automatic step mode. Note that the axes will decorate 
by choosing a step which is a devisor of the range [0, 90] in degrees ([0, 100] in grads).<br />
When you check the "Dock" check box the axis will be docked to the outer polar rim. You can also cross the angle
axis to a value on a polar value axis.<br />
Use the "Begin Angle" up down to control the orientation of the polar chart.<br />
