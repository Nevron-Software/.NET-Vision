This example demonstrates a 3D step line chart.<br>
You can change the style of the line from the Line Style combo. The "Line Depth %" scroller 
controls the size of the Tape lines. The "Line Size" scroller controls the size of the Tube 
and Ellipsoid lines.<br>
When you check the Inflate Margins check the axis scales are adjusted 
to fit the entire chart including the series markers.<br>
The Left Axis Round to tick check controls whether the left axis should 
automatically round its min and max values to end on exact ticks.
