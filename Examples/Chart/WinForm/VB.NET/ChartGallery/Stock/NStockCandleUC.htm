Candle Stock charts are displayed when the CandleStyle property of the 
Stock series is set to Candle.<br>
A candle is considered with up orientation if the open value is smaller than 
the close value - otherwise the candle is considered with down orientation. 
The Stock series automatically paints the candles in the appropriate color 
(defined by its orientation).<br>
The filling of the up and down candles can be changed from the Up Candle 
Fill Style and Down Candle Fill Style buttons respectively.<br>
The border of the up and down candles can be changed from the Up Candle Border 
and Down Candle Border buttons respectively.<br>
The Show High Low Line check controls the visibility of the line connecting the 
high and low values.<br>
You can change the stroke style of the high-low line from the High Low Line Color 
button.
