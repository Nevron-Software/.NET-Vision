This example demonstrates a vertical Error Bar chart. Error bars are used to indicate the estimated 
error in a measurement. The most common error bar plot is one in which the errors are in the Y values.
You can use the controls to modify different properties of the error bar series like error whisker size, 
upper / lower error visibility etc.
