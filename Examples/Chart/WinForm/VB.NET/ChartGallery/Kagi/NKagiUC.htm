Kagi charts display series of vertical lines to illustrate general levels of 
supply and demand for certain assets. The thickness and direction of the lines 
are dependent on the price action. Thick lines are drawn when the price breaks 
above the previous high price and is interpreted as an increase in demand. Thin 
lines are used to represent increased supply when the price falls below the 
previous low. Kagi charts ignore the passage of time.
