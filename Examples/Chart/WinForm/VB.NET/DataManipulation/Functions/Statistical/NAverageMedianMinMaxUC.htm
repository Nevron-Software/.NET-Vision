This example demonstrates the Min, Max and Average functions. Use the 'Function' combo 
to switch between them. The expression which is used for the calculation of 
the selected function is displayed in the blue label. The Min, Max and Average 
functions support grouping of the input values - in this way a result value is 
calculated for every group of N elements, and not for the whole input data series. 
This feature is controlled by the 'Grouping' combo.
