Covariance and correlation are closely related parameters that indicate the 
extent to which two random variables co-vary. Suppose there are two technology 
stocks. If the price of one rises, the price of the other is also likely to rise. 
If the price of one falls, the price of the other is also likely to fall. The two 
prices tend to co-vary. They have positive covariance and positive correlation.
