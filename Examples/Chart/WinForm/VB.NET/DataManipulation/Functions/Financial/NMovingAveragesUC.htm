<P>A Moving Average is an indicator that shows the average value of a security's 
	price over a period of time. A <STRONG>Simple, or Arithmetic, Moving Average</STRONG>
	is calculated by adding the price of the security for a number of time periods 
	(e.g. 12 days) and then dividing this total by the number of time periods. The 
	result is the average price of the security over the time period. Simple moving 
	averages give equal weight to each daily price.
</P>
<P>A <STRONG>Weighted Moving Average</STRONG> is designed to put more weight on 
	recent data and less weight on past data. A weighted moving average is 
	calculated by multiplying each of the previous day's data by a weight (the 
	weight is the index of the data).</P>
<P>An <STRONG>Exponential Moving Average</STRONG> is calculated by applying a 
	percentage of today's closing price to yesterday's moving average value. 
	Exponential moving averages place more weight on recent prices.</P>
<P>The <STRONG>Modified Moving Average</STRONG> is the same as the Exponential 
	Moving Average. The only difference is in the period of the functions. For 
	example a 14-day MMA is the same as 27-day EMA.</P>
