	<P><STRONG>Bollinger Bands</STRONG> are drawn at a given number of standard deviations from a 
		moving average of a price. Since standard deviation is a measure of volatility, 
		the bands are self-adjusting: widening during volatile markets and contracting 
		during calmer periods. Bollinger Bands were created by John Bollinger.</P>
	<P>An <STRONG>Envelope</STRONG> is comprised of two moving averages. One moving average is shifted 
		upward and the second moving average is shifted downward.</P>
