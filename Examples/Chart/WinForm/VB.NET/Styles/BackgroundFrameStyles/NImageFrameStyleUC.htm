This example demonstrates the built-in image (artistic) borders of the component.<br>
<br>
Image borders can come handy when you have to build presentation quality charts 
or you simply want to achieve better integration with your application design.<br>
<br>
Choose an image border type from the 'Image border type' combo.<br>
The Fill Style, Shadow and Border buttons allow you to modify the NFillStyle, 
NShadowStyle and NStrokeStyle objects applied to the image frame<br>
The rest of the parameters control the size of the image borders tubes and 
corners. Note that the tube size cannot exceed the corner size.
