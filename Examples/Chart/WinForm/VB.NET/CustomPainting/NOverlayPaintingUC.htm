Overlay painting allows you to draw custom graphics on top of the chart control without repainting the charts.
This is useful when you have to draw interactive content on top of a complex chart scene.

This example demonstrates basic usage of the Overlay Painting feature. When you move the mouse over the chart multiple 
circles are displayed trailing after the mouse pointer. Press the mouse Left and Right buttons to change the color and size of the circles.
