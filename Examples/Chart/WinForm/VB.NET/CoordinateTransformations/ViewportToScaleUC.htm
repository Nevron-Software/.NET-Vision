The example demonstrates how to convert from viewport to space units. This 
conversion in the case of 3D always requires an additional plane. In the 
example you can choose between a XY or XZ plane but you can also use YZ for 
example.<br>
The "Mouse Mode" combo selects the current mouse mode.<br>
If you choose Create point when you click with the mouse on the chart a new 
point will be created at the projected space coordinates.<br>
The "Create point at plane" combo selects the plane where the new point will 
lie.<br>
Use the "XZ plane value" and "XY plane value" to change the XZ and XY planes on 
the PrimaryY and Depth axes respectively.<br>
The "Clamp values to ruler" specifies whether to clamp the space units 
according to the ruler min/max value.
