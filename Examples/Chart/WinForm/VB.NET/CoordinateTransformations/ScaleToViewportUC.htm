The example demonstrates how to convert from scale to control viewport units as 
well as custom painting using watermarks.<br>
From the Watermark position combo choose how the watermark should determine its 
position<br>
If you choose "Position in scale Units" you can modify the position of the 
watermark at the primary X, primary Y and Depth axes<br>
If you choose "Position from Data Point" you can select a data point that 
provides the (x, y, z) scale coordinates where the watermark is attached to.
