The example demonstrates the date time scaling features in Nevron Chart. In this example the scale will 
automatically select a date time unit and step in this date time unit according to the date time range you 
specify using the date time pickers.<br>
Note that you can enable / disable different date time units and the scale will pick the most appropriate 
one depending on its size and date time range. When you check the Enable Unit Sensitive Formatting check 
box the scale will also use a date time formatting string that is most appropriate for the currently determined
unit for the scale.
