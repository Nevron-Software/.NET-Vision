The example demonstrates the ability of the timeline and date/time scales 
to skip date time ranges, when it is expected that there is no data for them. 
Common applications of this feature are financial charts that usually display only working week days as 
stock markets are closed on weekends.<br />
Click on the "Enable Week Rule" if you want to enable/disable weekday working or non working pattern. The check boxes below allow you to select the working days in a week.<br />
Click on the "Enable Month Day Rule" if you want to enable/disable a specific month day (each first month day in this example).<br />
The chart will generate data that does not contain information for the non working days defined by the above rules.<br />
Press the Zoom To First 7 Days to view how the chart has hidden the days you did not select as Working.<br />
Press the Zoom to First 30 Days to view how the chart has hidden (or shown) the explicit work/non work day selected by the month day rule.<br />
