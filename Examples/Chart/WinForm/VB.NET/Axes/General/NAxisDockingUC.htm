Nevron Chart can have an unlimited number of custom vertical and 
horizontal axes. You can specify the axis on which a particular 
series is scaled.<br>
In this example there are three series each scaling on a different axis (red, green and blue).<br>
The 
axes can be docked to an arbitrary axis dock zone. For simplicity in this example only the Front Left and Front Right zones are included.
