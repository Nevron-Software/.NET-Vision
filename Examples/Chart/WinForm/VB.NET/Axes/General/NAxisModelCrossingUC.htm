This example demonstrates the ability of Nevron Chart to
synchronize the position of an axis with a model coordinate on the chart area.
This is achieved by using the NCrossAxisAnchor in combination with a
NModelCrossing object specifying the offset and alignment from the chart area
used for crossing.
