The example demonstrates how to add custom range labels to a scale in order to annotate ranges of data.<br />
Press the mouse over the chart and drag in order to select a range. Then a scrollbar will appear on the X axis allowing 
you to navigete through the data.<br />
Use the controls on the right to modify the properties of the labels on the x axis:<br />
Label Visibility Mode - control when range labels will be visible. Possible options are:
<ul>
<li>Center in ruler - in this mode the label will be shown only when its center is contained in the scale visible range</li>
<li>Text In Ruler - in this mode the label will be shown only when the text is completely contained with the scale visible range</li>
<li>Text Intersects Ruler - in this mode the label will be shown only when the text intersects with the scale visible range</li>
</ul>
Label Tick Mode - controls the apperance of ticks showing the range denoted by the label. Possible options are:
<ul>
<li>None - no ticks are displayed</li>
<li>Separators - vertical lines are drawn the range begin and end values</li>
<li>Top - a range tick is visualized on the top of the label</li>
<li>Center - a range tick is visualized enclosing the label with brackets</li>
</ul>
Wrap Text - controls whether text should be wrapped inside the range denoted by the label.<br />
Angle - controls the angle of the label's text.<br />
The rest of the controls modify some properties of the label ticks.<br />
