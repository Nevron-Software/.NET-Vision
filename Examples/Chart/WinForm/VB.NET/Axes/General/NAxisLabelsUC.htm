Automatic labels generated by the component can often overlap. Nevron Chart allows you to have full control
at both how axis labels are generated and how the scale will resolve label overlapping.<br/>
The label generation mode allows you to specify the number of scale label levels generated by the scale. This is
often very useful when you anticipate that the auto labels will overlap. Furthermore you can specify different strategies
that the scale can use to resolve overlapping when it occurs. <br/>
Note that for the purpose of this example the scales are configured intentionally to generate more labels.<br/>
In practice the device length dependent generation of scale labels and ticks will avoid most of the cases when overlapping occurs.<br/>
