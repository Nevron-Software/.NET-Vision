This example demonstrates the ability of Nevron Chart to inflate the logical range of the axis in several modes.
<br />
You can change the inflate mode using the "View Range Inflate Mode" combo on the right. There are four options:
<li>Major Tick - inflate the range so that it always ends to an exact major tick value</li>
<li>Major Tick Extend - inflate the range so that it always ends to an exact major tick value. If original range ends at exact tick value it will be extended with one tick.</li>
<li>Logical - inflate the range in logical units</li>
<li>Absolute - inflate the range in points (allows you to specify margins for the series content from the chart edges)</li>
