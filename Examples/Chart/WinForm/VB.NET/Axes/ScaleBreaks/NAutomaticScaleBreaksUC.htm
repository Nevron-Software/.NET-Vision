This example shows how to add automatic scale breaks on the Y chart axis. Scale breaks 
will be introduced when the data shown on the axis is not regularly spead over the axis range. 
<br />
Use the Enable Automatic Scale Breaks check box to enable / disable scale breaks on the primary Y axis.
<br />
The Threshold factor controls when a scale break should be introduced - bigger values for this property 
will descrease the number of possible scale breaks. The example has been designed to work with threshold of
0.25 and up to three scale breaks. 
<br />
The Length up down control allows you to modify the length of the scale break on the axis.
<br />
The Position mode combo box allows you to control the placement of the automatic scale breaks on the
axis.
