	<P>
	The example demonstrates how to use the Nevron Diagram for .NET to display organization charts. 
	This example uses the following features:
	<p>
		1. Table shapes - each person of the organization is represented by a 
		table shape, containing 3 cells - one for the person's image, one for his name
		and one for his position.
	</p>
	<p>
		2. Click events - upon clicking on a person more detailed information is shown in
		the panel to the right.
	</p>
	<p>
		3. Data import - the data is imported from a database, using the NTreeDataSourceImporter
		class.
	</p>
	<p>
	    4. Show/Hide subtree decorators are used to allow the user to expand/collapse the subtrees
	    of each shape (except for the leafs).
