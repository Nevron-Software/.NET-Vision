		This example demonstrates how to use the class importer to create a class
		hierarchy diagram based on a given class. The class importer creates an UML
		shape for the base class and for each of its subclasses. You can change the
		member format style of the shapes from the 'format style' combo box and the base
		class of the hierarchy from the 'base class' combo box.
	</p>
	<p>
		All you have to do if you want to create a class hierarchy diagram is to create an instance
		of the <b>NClassImporter</b> class, provide a drawing document to its contructor and then call
		the <b>Import</b> method specifying the class to be on the top of the class hierarchy. The class
		importer investigates the assembly the specified class belongs to and automatically creates,
		links and layouts the UML shapes.
