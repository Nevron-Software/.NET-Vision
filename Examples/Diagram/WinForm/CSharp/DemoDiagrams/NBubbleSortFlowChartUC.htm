	The example demonstrates how to use the Nevron Diagram for .NET to display flow charts. 
	This example uses the following features:
	<p>
	1. Predefined Flow Charting Shapes - the component comes with built in support for a myriad of commonly used flow charting shapes.
	</P>
	<p>
	2. Ports on 1D shapes - in this example there are three end plugs connected to the logical line ports of connectors. 
	In Nevron Diagram for .NET even connectors can have multiple ports and labels.
	</P>
	<p>
	3. Lighting filter - in this example the default fill style of the document has a lighting filter, which 
	greatly contributes to the overall visual impact. Note that image filters can also be applied to texts!
