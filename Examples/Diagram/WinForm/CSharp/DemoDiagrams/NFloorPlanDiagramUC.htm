	<P>
	This example demonstrates how to use the Nevron Diagram for .NET to display flow charts. 
	The example uses the following features:
	<p>
		1. Predefined Flow Charting Shapes - the component comes with built in support 
		for a myriad of commonly used flowcharting shapes.
	</p>
	<p>
		2. Custom ports on 2D shapes - in this example the connectors connecting the 
		"Evaluate revisions" and "Answer client emails" shapes are attached to custom 
		rotated bounds ports.
	</p>
	<p>
		3. Step3 connectors - both the percentage and offset modes of the step3 
		connectors are demonstrated in this example.
	</p>
	<p>
		4. Style sheets - this example extensively uses style sheets. Style sheets can 
		help you consistenly display shapes from different categories. They can also 
		minimize the diagram memory footprint.
