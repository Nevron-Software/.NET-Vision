	The example demonstrates how to use the Nevron Diagram for .NET to create interactive diagrams. 
	This example uses the following features:
	<p>
		1. Event bubbling - in this example the expand/collapse checks are composite shapes, 
		which bubble events to the expandable shapes (implemented as 
		groups). Expandable shapes intercept the left mouse down event and if 
		it was bubbled from the expand-collapse check shape, expand or collapse the respective subtree.
	</p>
	<p>
		2. Shape navigation - in this example we have demonstrated how easy it is 
		to navigate through the connected shapes with the built-in shape 
		navigation support.
	</p>
	<p>
		3. Custom shape bounds - in this example the expandable shapes (implememented as groups) 
		are resized to fit only the rectangle shape (do not include the bounds of the expand-collapse check).
	</p>
	<p>
		4. Resize in aggregate - expand-collapse checks uses RepositionOnly resize in aggregate. 
		That is why when the expandable shapes are resized the checks preserve their size. 
	</p>
	<p>
		5. Force Directed and Tree Layout - this example does not use predefined 
		positions for the shapes, but instead performs a tree layout followed by 
		a force directed layout. Automatic layouts are an indispensable feature when it 
		comes to reordering large or dynamically generated structures.
