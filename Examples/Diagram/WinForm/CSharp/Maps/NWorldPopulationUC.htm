        <b>Nevron Diagram</b> makes it easy to import geographical data from Esri shapefiles. You
        can import the shapes in separate layers and control the way they are rendered applying
        various styles to them. Also additional information is provided for each shape
        (such as Country Name, Area, Population, Currency, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
        This example shows a world population map by countries (darker countries have larger population).
        A fill rule is used to automatically color the countries on the map based on their population
        attribute.
    </p>
	<p>
	    You can play with the example zooming the map in and out using the scrollbar or clicking the scrollbar
	    and using the mouse wheel afterwards. You can also see the available data for the shapes and change the
	    data grouping policy.
