        <b>Nevron Diagram</b> makes it easy to import geographical data from Esri shapefiles. You
        can import the shapes in separate layers and control the way they are rendered applying
        various styles to them. Also additional information is provided for each shape
        (such as Country Name, Area, Population, Currency, etc.)
    </p>        
    <p>
        You can add more attributes to the shapes through data binding. All you have to do is to
        call one of the DataBind methods of the <i>NEsriShapefile</i> passing a data source and a
		data binding context, which should provide information about the column matchings between the
		map and the binding table and the columns from the binding table to import to the map table.
		<b>Map fill rules</b> and <b>data grouping policies</b> can be used to automatically color map
		shapes based on the value of a specified shape attribute. The RoundedRanges property of the data
		grouping object determines whether to round the data ranges numbers to "nicer" numbers. For example,
		the most rounded number in the range [867, 1100] is 1000.
    </p>
	<p>
	    You can play with the example zooming the map in and out using the scrollbar or clicking the scrollbar
	    and using the mouse wheel afterwards. You can also change the data grouping policy used by the fill rule
	    to color the map.
