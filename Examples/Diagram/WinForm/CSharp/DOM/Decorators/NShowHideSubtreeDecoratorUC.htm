The show-hide subtree decorator is a decorator, which consists of a symbol and background. Clicking the expand-collapse decorator toggles the visibility state of the shape destination shapes and the outgoing shapes. When hiding the subtree, this process is repeated for each destination shape. When showing the subtree this process is repeated for each destination shape if the ShowChildrenOnly property is set to false.
