		This example demonstrates the built in support for different graph traversal 
		methods.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are generally three graph traversal methods:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Depth First Traversal</b>
			- in this type of graph traversal the algorithm first visits the start vertex 
			and then recursively visits its destination or neighbour vertices (depending on 
			whether you want to treat the graph as directed or undirected).
			<li>
				<b>Breadth First Traversal</b>
			- in this type of graph traversal the algorithm first visits the starting 
			vertex, then all the vertices which can be reached in one step, then in two 
			steps and so on. In Breadth First Traversal you can also treat the graph as 
			directed or undirected.
			<li>
				<b>Topological Order Traversal</b> - in this type of graph traversal the 
				algorithm visits the vertices in their topological order. A topological sort is 
				a list of the vertices of a directed graph in which all the successors of any 
				given vertex appear in the sequence after that vertex. Topological Order 
				Traversal is only applicable for directed graphs.
			</li>
		</ul>

		To explore graph traversal just click on a shape to select it. 
		The example will automatically highlight the visited shapes and assign a visiting order to them.
