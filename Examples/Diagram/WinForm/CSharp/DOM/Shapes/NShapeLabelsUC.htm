		This example demonstrates shape labels.
	</p>
	<p>
		Labels are one of the optional shape elements (the other two optional elements 
		are ports and control points). Labels are texts, which can be anchored to a specific aspect of the shape 
		to which they belong, or to any model inside this shape. The actual model to 
		which a label is anchored is called anchor model.
	</p>
	<p>
		Currently Nevron Diagram for .NET supports the following types of labels:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Bounds Labels</b> - bounds labels are anchored to the scene bounds of the anchor model.
				In this example the red shape has two bounds labels. If you rotate this shape, the labels will 
				remain horizontal.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Rotated Bounds Labels</b> - rotated bounds labels are anchored to the scene projection of 
				the model bounds of the anchor model. In this example the blue shape has two rotated bounds labels. 
				If you rotate this shape, the labels will be rotated with it.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Logical Line Labels</b> - logical line labels are anchored to the percent position 
				of a anchor model logical line. This type of label can be configured to follow the line orientation. 
				You can also instruct it never to have downward orientation. In this example the polyline shape 
				has two logical line labels.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

		To explore the labels behavior just select a shape and modify the label properties, 
		which will appear in the Example form
