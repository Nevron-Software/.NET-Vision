		This example demonstrates how to create a custom 2D shape. It also demonstrates 
		the ability to define ports, which are anchored to the primitives used to build 
		the shape.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this example the coffee cup consists of three parts - cup, handle and steam. 
		They all have different fill style, but inherit the shadow style of the 
		document.
	</p>
	<p>
		The coffee cup has two ports:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Dynamic port anchored to the cup part of the shape. Note than the 1D shapes 
				connecting the shapes glue to the contour of the cup.
			</li>
			<li>
				Rotated bounds port anchored to the middle right side of the handle.
			</li>
		</ol>
