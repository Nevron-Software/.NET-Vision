		This example demonstrates bridgeable shapes and bridges.
	</p>
	<p>
		Bridges (hops) are a special type of decoration of flat open figure paths, 
		which can be displayed on path self intersections or intersections with other 
		bridgeable paths below it in the ZOrder. Path primitives, which can display 
		bridges are called bridgeable paths. Bridgeable paths implement the 
		INBridgeablePath interface.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are several condinitions, which must be met in order for a bridgeable 
		path to be able to display bridges. They are:
		<ol>
			<li>
				The bridgeable path must be aggregated by a bridgeable shape (shapes which 
				implement the INBrideableShape interface).
			</li>
			<li>
				The composed bridge style of the bridgeable path must have a valid bridge style 
				definition.
			</li>
			<li>
				The bridgeable shape BridgeTargets property must be different from None
			</li>
			<li>
				The bridge manager must be enabled.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		Bridge generation obeys to several asthetic criterias, the most important of 
		which are:
		<ol>
			<li>
				When two bridges, which belong to the same bridgeable path segment overrlap, 
				they are merged to create a larger bridge.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bridges are not created for intersection points, which are closer than half the 
				bridge width to the start or end point of the bridgeable path segment to which 
				they belong.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		Although that in this example the bridges are demonstated only with line and polyline shapes, 
		you should know that step connectors and routable connectors of type Dynamic HV and Dynamic Polyline 
		are also capable of displaying bridges.
