		This example demonstrates the built-in step and arrow connectors:

		Step connectors are 1D shapes, which connect their start and end points in a finite 
		number of orthogonal steps (horizontal or vertical). Currently there are two 
		types of step connectors:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Step2 connector</b> - this connector connects its start and end points in 
				two orthogonal steps. The orientation of the first step can be controlled, 
				hence the Step2 connectors are often called HV, VH or L-shaped connectors. 
				Step2 connectors can be reversed.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Step3 connector</b> - this connector connects its start and end points in 
				three orthogonal steps. The orientation of the first step can be controlled, 
				hence the Step3 connectors are often called HVH or VHV connectors. The position 
				of the the Step3 connector middle segment can be specified in two ways:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Percent</i> - in this mode the middle segment is positioned in the percent 
						equivalent of the distance between the start and end points. For example: for a 
						HVH connector with percent 50 this is the middle between the start and end 
						points X coordinates.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Offset</b> - in this mode the middle segment is offset from the min or max coordinate of 
						the start and end points. For example: for a HVH connector with offset 50 this is offset 50 from 
						the max value between the start and end points X coordinates. For an HVH connector 
						with offset -50 this is offset -50 from the min value between the start and end 
						points X coordinates.
				</ul>
				Step3 connectors can be reversed and reflexed.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Arrow connectors are 1D shapes, which connect their start and end points with a single or double arrow. 
		Arrow connectors can be reversed.
