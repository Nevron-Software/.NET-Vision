		This example demonstrates shape ports.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ports are one of the optional shape elements (the other two optional elements 
		are control points and labels). Ports are connection points to which multiple 
		plugs can be attached. Ports can be anchored to a specific aspect of the shape 
		to which they belong, or to any model inside this shape. The actual model to 
		which a port is anchored is called anchor model.
	</p>
	<p>
		Currently Nevron Diagram for .NET supports the following types of ports:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Dynamic port</b> - this is a port, whose location is aligned relative to the 
				rotated bounds of the anchor model. Unlike the rest of the ports, which glue 
				the connected plugs to the port location, the dynamic port can be configured to 
				glue the plugs in several modes.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Bounds port</b>  - this is a port, whose location is aligined relative to the scene 
				bounds of the anchor model.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Rotated bounds port</b> - this is a port, whose location is aligined relative to 
				the scene protection of the model bounds of the anchor model.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Logical line port</b> - this is a port, whose location is positioned at the percent 
				position along the logical line of the acnhor model.
			</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		To explore the ports behavior just select a shape and modify the port properties which 
		will appear in the Example form.
