		This example demonstrates the primitive 1D Shapes, which are: NLineShape, 
		NCircularArcShape, NEllipticalArcShape, NPolylineShape, NBezierCurveShape and 
		NClosedCurveShape.
	</p>
	<p>
		Common for primitive 1D shapes is that they all aggregate a single open figure 
		path primitive of the respective type. For example the NLineShape aggregates a 
		single NLinePath primitive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Open figure paths can be configured to display arrowheads at their start and 
		end points. Arrowheads can have their own fill and stroke styles and 
		automatically follow the orientation of the path at its start/end position 
		respectively. Arrowheads adopt the shadow style of the path for which their are 
		displayed. The arrowheads of a path are displayed with the composed 
		StartArrowheadStyle and EndArrowheadStyle respecively.
	</p>
	<p>
		Open figure paths can be displayed with no arrowheads at all - in this example 
		all random strokes are displayed without arrowheads.
	</p>
	<p>
		By design primitive 1D Shapes have a single logical line label anchored to the 
		shape itself. To change the label text just click on the shape and type.
