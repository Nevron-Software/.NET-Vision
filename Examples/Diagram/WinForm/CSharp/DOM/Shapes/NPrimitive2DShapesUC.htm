This example demonstrates the primitive 2D Shapes, which are: NRectangleShape, NEllipseShape, NPolygonShape and NClosedCurveShape.
</p>
<p>
Common for primitive 2D shapes is that they all aggregate a single closed figure path primitive of the respective type.
For example the NRectangleShape aggregates a single NRectanglePath primitive.

<p>
By design primitive 2D Shapes have a single rotated bounds label anchored to the shape itself. 
To change the label text just double click on the shape and type.
