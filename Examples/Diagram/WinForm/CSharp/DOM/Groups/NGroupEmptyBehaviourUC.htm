		This example demonstrates how to instruct groups to automatically destroy 
		themselves, when they become empty and how to prevent groups&nbsp;from becoming 
		empty.
	</p>
	<p>
		To explore how autodestruction works perform the following steps:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Select the group
			</li>
			<li>
				In the Example form check the <b>Auto destroy if empty</b> check box
			</li>
			<li>
				Drill down to select a group child shape
			</li>
			<li>
				Press the Del button
			</li>
			<li>
				Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all group child shapes are deleted
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		At the end of this operation the group will automatically be destroyed. If you 
		did not check <b>Auto destroy if empty check</b> the group will still exist, 
		but it wont have any child nodes.
	</p>
	<p>
		To explore how empty prevention works perform the following steps:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Reset the example
			</li>
			<li>
				Select the group
			</li>
			<li>
				In the Example form uncheck the <b>Can be empty</b> check box
			</li>
			<li>
				Drill down to select a group child shape
			</li>
			<li>
				Press the Del button
			</li>
			<li>
				Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all group child shapes are deleted
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		When you try to delete the last shape an error message will pop up to indicate that this operation is not allowed.
