		This example demonstrates the built in support for grouping and ungrouping.
	<p>
	<p>
		<b>Grouping</b> is the process of creation of a new group from a set of already existing shapes. 
		The shapes which must be grouped must have a group permission. When shapes are grouped they are deleted 
		from the current composite in which they reside (a layer or another group) and added to the Shapes collection 
		of the newly created group. The grouped shapes will retain their position and size in scene coordinates.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Ungrouping</b> is the process of destruction of an existing group. The group must have 
		an ungroup permission in order to be ungrouped. You can optionally specify a composite
		in which the group shapes must be added. In this example if you select the blue 
		group you can ungroup it to the active layer. If you select the green group you 
		can optionally ungroup it in its parent group (the blue group).
	</p>
	<p>
		To select the green group you must click on the blue group first and then click 
		on an shape from the green group. This type of selection is called drill-down 
		selection.
