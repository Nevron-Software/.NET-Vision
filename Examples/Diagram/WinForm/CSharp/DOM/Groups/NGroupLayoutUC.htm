		This example demonstrates how to apply layouts on individual groups of shapes and on a set
		of given shapes. All you have to do is to initialize the layout context graph adapter and the
		body container adapter with a group of shapes or a list of the shapes you want to layout. Take
		a closer look at the source code (the method <i>LayoutGroups</i> and the event handlers for the
		buttons click events).
