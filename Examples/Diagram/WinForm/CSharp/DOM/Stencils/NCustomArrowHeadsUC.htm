The example demonstrates the ability to define and use custom arrowheads, which can be primitive and aggregate (composite) models. 
</p>
<p>
Select the shape to which you want to apply custom arrowheads and specify the custom arrowhead from the 
arrowhead combos located in the Example form. Note that you can apply them to any shape - just create 
some 1D shape (for example a line) and perform the same action.
