		This example demonstrates the diagram elements abilities, protection and 
		permissions.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Nevron Diagram for .NET each diagram element exposes a set of abilities 
		(i.e. informs the framework what operations the end user can perform with it). 
		The element must have the respective ability in order for some operation to be 
		performed on it. For example: you cannot select an element, which does not have 
		a Select ability.
	</p>The element protection defines the 
subset of the element abilities, which are explicitly disabled. For example: 
even though a shape has the ability to be selected, the end user will still not 
be able to select a shape if it is protected from selection. 
<P></P>
	<p>
		The element permissions defines a subset of the element abilities, which are 
		allowed to the end user. The element permissions are by default computed by 
		getting the element abilities and removing from them the element protection 
		(e.g. Abilities - Protection).
	</p>
	<p>
		Elements however can decide to extend the basic permissions calculation and 
		drop additional permissions as they see fit. For example: a shape will 
		automatically drop its delete permission if it is the last shape of a group, 
		which cannot be empty (e.g, the group CanBeEmpty property is set to false). In 
		this way the user will not be able to delete the shape, although&nbsp;the 
		shape&nbsp;has the ability to be deleted and is not protected from delete.
	</p>
	<p>
		From a programmers point of view, it is enough to check whether an element has 
		the respective permission in order to perform some operation with it. If the 
		developer wants to explicitly disable some element ability all that is needed 
		is to raise the respective element protection flag.
