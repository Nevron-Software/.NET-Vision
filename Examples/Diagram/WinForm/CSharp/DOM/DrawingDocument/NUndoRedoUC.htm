		This example demonstrates the document history service.
	</p>
	<p>
		The document history service is used to record all user and prorammable actions, which modify the document content.
		All properties and methods of all DOM elements, which modify the respective object state record history operations.
		History operations can be grouped in transactions, which are logically treated as a single operation. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Transactions can be commited or rolled back. All history actions performed while there is an opened transaction 
		are recorded in it. If you commit a transaction it will be recorded in the history Undo stack. If you roll it 
		back the transaction will apply all its actions in reverse order and will not be recorded. 
		Transactions can be nested.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this example we have created three groups all of them added to the document in single transactions. 
		You can explore the current state of the history via the History Undo and Redo list boxes.
	</p>
	<p>
		To explore history transactions, click on the <b>Start History Transaction</b> button and specify its name. 
		Then move the document objects to some arbitrary positions. You can finally either commit or rollback the 
		transaction by clicking on the Commit or Rollback buttons. In case you click the <b>Commit</b> button the transaction 
		will become visible in the Undo list. In case you click the <b>Rollback</b> button the document will be restored to 
		the state it had when you started the transaction.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can Pause and Resume the history service - in this example this is done by the <b>Record History</b> checkbox.
