	<P>This example demonstrates the different modes in which drawing documents can 
		determine their bounds (controlled by the AutoBoundsMode combo). Currently 
		supported are the following modes:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI>
		Custom Non Constrained - in this mode the&nbsp;user specifies the drawing 
		bounds and the drawing content is not restricted to be positioned outside these 
		bounds.
		<LI>
		Custom Constrained - in this mode the&nbsp;user specifies the drawing bounds 
		and the drawing content is&nbsp;constrained in them. Try to mode the rectangles 
		outside the drawing bounds to see how the framework will not allow you to go 
		outside of them.
		<LI>
		Auto Size to Content - in this mode the document automatically determines the 
		bounds of its content and sizes to fit it.
		<LI>
			Auto Inflate to Content - in this mode the document automatically determines 
			the amount with which its bounds must be inflated in order to fit all content.
		</LI>
	</UL>
	<p>
		When the document is configured to automatically update its bounds you also 
		have control over its minimal width and height. The auto bounds padding refers 
		to the padding with which the document content is inflated before the automatic 
		bounds are constructed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that the <b>Inflate to Content</b> and <b>Size to Content</b> logic can be 
		applied even if the document is not configured to automatically inflate or size to its content
	</p>
