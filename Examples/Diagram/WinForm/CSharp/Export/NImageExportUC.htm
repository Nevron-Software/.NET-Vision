		This example demonstrates the built in support for image export, 
		which is implemented by the NImageExporter extension. 
	</p>
	<p>
		When exporting a document, which is defined in some absolute measurement units (i.e. millimiter, inch etc.), 
		the image exporter provides you with the ability to specify a custom resolution, which must be used for the image export.
		This is particularly useful if for example you want to general a printer ready bitmap. In this example you can change the 
		document measurement unit from the <b>Document measurement unit combo</b>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The image exporter also allows you to export only a portion of the document to image. To test this 
		functionality do the following:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Select several shapes from the diagram
			</li>
			<li>
				Click the Show Image Export Dialog
			</li>
			<li>
				From the load known bound combo select the Selection Bounds option. 
				This will cause the image exporter to generate an image for the bounds of the selected objects only.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		Related to image export is the Export permission, which specifies whether the element can be exported (to image, SVG etc.)
		or not. In this example the red shape in the top left corner is protected from export and will 
		not be present in the generated image. It will of course not be visible in the image export preview also.
