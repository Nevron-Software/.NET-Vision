		This example demonstrates the browser redirection in a flash exported diagram. When you set the
		interactivity style of a shape to point to a website, the Flash exporter automatically creates
		a hyperlink for the shape. You should know that because the Flash movie is exported locally
		by this example you should allow the directory this flash movie is exported into to redirect
		your browser. Otherwise you links may not work when the SWF file is started locally.
