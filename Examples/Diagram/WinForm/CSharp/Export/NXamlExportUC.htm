		This example demonstrates the built in support for XAML export, 
		which is implemented by the NXamlExporter extension. When you click on the &lt;Export to XAML&gt;
		button a XAML file is generated and saved in the application's startup directory. The file is then
		opened with your default XAML viewer.

	<p>Exporting to Flash is as easy as writing 2 lines of code:<br />
		<div style="background-color:#E0FFFF;width:400px;border:solid 1 #000000;margin-top:10px;padding:3px">
			NXamlExporter exporter = new NXamlExporter(document);<br />
			exporter.SaveToFile(fileName);
		</div>
	</p>
