		This example demonstrates the ability to drag and drop custom data objects to the drawing view.
	</p>
	<p>
		The easiest way to provide custom drag and drop is to override the existing or create new data object 
		adaptors. In this example we have created a custom data object adaptor, which adapts image and 
		custom data objects, containing a shape name and desired size. This should be enough for 
		the diagram to generate correct previews and drop the adapted content in the active layer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Specific applications need to handle drop on shapes or groups in different ways. The currently 
		implementation of the NDragDropTargetTool simply adds the adapted content in the active layer. 
		In this example we have shown how to override its default behavior in case the object was dropped 
		on a group.
