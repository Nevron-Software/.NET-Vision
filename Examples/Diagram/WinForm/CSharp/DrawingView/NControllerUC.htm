The example demonstrates how to enable the controller tools as well as how to implement a custom tool and 
plug it into the controller.

The custom tool implemented in this example performs rectangular zoom in. With a left mouse double click you can restore the zoom factor to 1. 
To test the tool just select it from the <b>Enabled Tool Combo</b> in the Example form and drag a rectangle in the designer.

The example also demonstrates how to enable composite tools - like the pointer tool.
