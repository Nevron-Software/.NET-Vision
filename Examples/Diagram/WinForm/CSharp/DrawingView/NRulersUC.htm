		This example demonstrates the view rulers. The rulers are one of the useful view components that can help 
		you better align and arrange diagram elements. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The coordinate from which all major ticks originate is called ruler origin. In this example the ruler origin is controlled by the 
		<b>Origin</b> numeric up down.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the most important rulers features is that their measurement unit can be different from the document measurement unit.
	</p>
	<p>
		You have full control over the colors, which are used for the visualization of the different ruler elements.
	</p>
	<p>
		The major ticks step of the ruler can also be determined in several modes, which are:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Normal</i> - in this mode the ruler autmatically chooses a step, which takes into account the current zoom factor
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Fine</i> - this mode uses a step, which is twice smaller than the normal step
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Coarse</i> - this mode uses a step, which is twice bigger than the normal step
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Fixed</i> - in this mode the user specifies the ruler major ticks step, which remains fixed and is not dependant on the zoom factor.
			</li>
		</ul>
