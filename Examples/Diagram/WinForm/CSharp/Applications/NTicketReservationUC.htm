	    This example demonstrates how to create a ticket reservation application using Nevron Diagram for .NET. When the user clicks on a shape (seat)
        its style sheet name is changed in order to mark it as reserved. The example also demonstrates the usage of protections, which helps us
        prevent the user from moving, resizing and deleting of shapes thus leaving him the only possible interaction he should be allowed to do -
        to click on shapes.
