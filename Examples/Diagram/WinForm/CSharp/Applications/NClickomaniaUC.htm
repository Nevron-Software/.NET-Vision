	    The example demonstrates how to utilize the per cell events of the table shape. We've implemented
	    the well known Clickomania game using only the table shape.

        Clickomania is a one-player game (puzzle) with the following rules. The board is a
        rectangular grid (this is where the NTableShape comes in handy). Initially the board
        is full of square blocks each colored one of k colors. A group is a collection of
        squares connected along edges that all have the same color. At any step, the player
        can click any group of size at least two. This move causes those blocks to disappear,
        and any blocks stacked above them fall straight down as far as they can. This falling
        is similar to Tetris, but each column falls independently. In particular, we never leave
        an internal hole. One final twist on the rules is that, if an entire column becomes empty
        of blocks, then the left and right components are slid together to remove the vertical hole.
