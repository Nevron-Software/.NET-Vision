	<P>
	   This example demonstrates the creation of a tournament diagram and makes use of the following features:
	</p>
	<ol>
	    <li>Table shapes are used to hold the information for the teams, their flags and the scores.</li>
		<li>Routable connectors are used to connect the matches from the different stages of the tournament.</li>
		<li>A layered graph layout with left to right direction is finally applied to layout the
		    diagram in the best human readable way.</li>
		<li>The shapes of the diagram have preset animations styles.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	    When you click on the Generate SWF or the Generate XAML button a movie (in the corresponding format)
		is generated and saved in the application's startup directory. The file is then opened with 
        the default viewer for the generated movie.
