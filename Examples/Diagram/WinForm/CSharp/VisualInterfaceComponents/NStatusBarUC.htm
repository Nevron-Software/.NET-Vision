		This example demonstrates the status bar component, which displays useful 
		information about the current state of a designer.
	</p>
	<p>
		To explore the status bar behavior do the following:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Pick a tool and activate it in the designer. For example to activate the 
				selector tool pick the pointer tool, click on the document and drag the mouse.
			</li>
			<li>
				The primary panel should be updated with the name of the currently active tool, 
				while the secondary panel must display tool sensitive information.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>	
	<p>
		In case there is no active tool the primary panel displays the Ready state, 
		while the secondary panel displays the selection bounds (if there is 
		selection).
	</p>	
	<p>
		Please note that information related scene coordinates is always measured in 
		the document unit of measure.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is also important to mention that the status bar update mechanizm is very 
		flexible and extensible and is in no way constrained to do only what it does by 
		default.
