		This example demonstrates how to import shapes from a Visio XML Stencil (VSX file). All you have to do is to
		add a reference to the Nevron.Diagram.Visio assembly and use the NVisioImporter class to import the shapes from
		the desired Visio Stencil into a Nevron library document. You can control the way the Visio Importer imports
		Visio shapes using its properties:
		<ul>
			<li>MeasurementUnit - determines the measurement unit the importer should use. By default set to inch
				(NGraphicsUnit.Inch), because inch is the default measurement unit used in Visio.</li>
			<li>PreserveShapeHierarchy - Controls whether the importer should preserve the shape hierarchy as in the Visio
				stencil thus creating nested groups or to import all Visio child shapes as custom paths in a composite shape.
				By default set to false. If you set this property to true the Visio child shapes will be imported as shapes
				in a group (or groups nested in a group) thus giving you a great level of control over each child shape and
				making it possible to use inherited styles. But note that this will also lead to higher memory consumption
				than the import of the Visio child shapes as custom paths in a composite shape.</li>
		</ul>
