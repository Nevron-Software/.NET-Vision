		This example demonstrates the predefined floor plan shapes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The predefined floor plan shapes can easily be created with the help of an instance of the NFloorPlanShapesFactory class.
		Note that the shapes in this stencil are defined in their actual size, 
		so in order to use them the drawing must use an appropriate drawing scale. 
		In this example the drawing scale is set to 1 doc millimeter = 0.01 world millimeter (100 : 1).
