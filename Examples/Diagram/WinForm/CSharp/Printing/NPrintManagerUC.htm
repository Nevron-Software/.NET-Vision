		This example demonstrates the built-in support for printing, which is 
		implemented by the NPrintManager extension.

	<p>
		Related to printing is the Print permission, which indicates whether the node 
		must be printed or not. In this example red shape in the top left corner is 
		protected from printing and will not be printed. It will of course not be 
		visible in the print preview also.

		The print manager can help you easily embed Page Setup and Print Preview 
		functionality in your application. In this example to setup the printer page, 
		just click the <b>Show Page Setup</b> button. To show the print preview - click 
		the <b>Show Print Preview</b> button.
	</p>

		Note that the print manager support paging. That is, if the document cannot be 
		fit in one printer page it will spread across several pages. It also supports 
		single page print, which refers to the ability to print a document larger than 
		the printer page on a single page by applying some layout to it - for example 
		Fit.
