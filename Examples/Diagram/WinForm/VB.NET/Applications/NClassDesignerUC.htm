	    This example demonstrates how to use UML shapes and the Nevron Class importer to import a class hierarchy in Nevron Diagram for .NET.
        Drag shapes from the library and then right click them and select properties to add properties and methods to the UML shapes or click
        the <b>Import class hierarchy</b> button, select an assembly and a type whose hierachy you want imported and click <b>Imort</b>. Please,
        note that if you uncheck the "Import class members" check box, only the class names will be imported.
