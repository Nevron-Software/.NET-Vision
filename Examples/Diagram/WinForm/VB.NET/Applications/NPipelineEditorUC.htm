	    This example demonstrates how to take advantage of inward ports and the Connecting event of the document's event sink service in order to
        build a pipeline editor application. Drag and Drop pipes from the pipes panel into the drawing area. When a pipe is near other pipe it sticks
        to its end if possible or bounces back, otherwise. Use the end pipe symbols (triangles) to mark pipe ends.
