		This example demonstrates the library browser and how to create new libraries and register them in the browser.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this example we have created a custom library named "My first library". The library hosts 
		two masters - one Star shape and one Octagon shape. You can drag and drop them in the designer.
	</p>
	<p>
		The library browser also supports the opposite action - you can drop some elements it in and it will 
		automatically create a new master for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this way you can use the designer to edit your custom shapes, drag and drop them in the 
		library you want and save the library for further reuse.
