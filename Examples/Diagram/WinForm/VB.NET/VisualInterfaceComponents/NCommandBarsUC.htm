		This example demonstrates how to implement custom commands and place them on 
		the command bars.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this example we have created a custom diagram command, which is represented 
		by the yellow smile face. It will show a message box when clicked.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to display a custom command in the toolbars you have to do the 
		following:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Register the commmand in the diagram commander commands collection
			</li>
			<li>
				Override the toolbars builder in order to place the command in a specific toolbar
			</li>
			<li>
				Recreate the command bars
			</li>
		</ol>	
	</p>
