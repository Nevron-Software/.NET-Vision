		This example demonstrates how to implement custom commands and show them in the context menus.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this example we have created a custom diagram command, which is represented by the yellow smile face 
		(perform a right click in the designer to show a context menu - the command should be last in the list).
		It will show a message box when clicked. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to display a custom command in the context menus you have to do the following:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Register the commmand in the diagram commander commands collection
			</li>
			<li>
				Override the context menus builder in order to place the command in context menus
			</li>
			<li>
				Recreate the command bars
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
