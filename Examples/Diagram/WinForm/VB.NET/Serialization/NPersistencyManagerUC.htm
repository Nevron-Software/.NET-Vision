The example demonstrates the built in support for persistency, which is implemented by the NPersistencyManager extension. 
</p>
<p>
The NPersistencyManager can be used to serialize/deserialize documents or only document parts to/from Binary, SOAP and 
XML streams and files.
</p>
<p>
In this example to save the document to file just click on the <b>Save to file</b> button and select the format 
in which you want to save your drawing. Respectively to load an already saved drawing click on the <b>Load from file</b> 
button and select the saved drawing file. Note that the manager will automatically determine the persistency format based 
on the file extension.
<p>
<p>
The example also demonstrates how to implement memory persistency via streams. Streams also support Binary, SOAP and XML 
persistency formats. In this example we have created three memory streams each one of which can be used to store the 
state of the drawing in the respective persistency format. To change the format use the <b>Persistency Format combo</b>. 
Use the <b>Save to stream</b> button to save the current drawing in the selected memory stream. 
Use the <b>Load from from stream</b> button to load the drawing with the selected memory stream content.
