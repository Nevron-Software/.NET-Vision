		This example demonstrates fade animations. A diagram is first loaded into the document, then
		a new layer containing white squares is placed above the loaded diagram. Finally, fade animations are
		added to the animations styles of these squares. When you click on the Generate SWF button a flash movie
		is generated and saved in the application's startup directory. The file is then opened with 
        the default viewer for flash movies.
