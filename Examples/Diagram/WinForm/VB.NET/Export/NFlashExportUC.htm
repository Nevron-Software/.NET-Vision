		This example demonstrates the built in support for Flash (SWF) export, 
		which is implemented by the NFlashExporter extension. When you click on the &lt;Export to SWF&gt;
		button a SWF file is generated and saved in the application's startup directory. The file is then
		opened with your default Flash player.
	</p>
	<p>Exporting to Flash is as easy as writing 2 lines of code:<br />
		<div style="background-color:#E0FFFF;width:400px;border:solid 1 #000000;margin-top:10px;padding:3px">
			NFlashExporter exporter = new NFlashExporter(document);<br />
			exporter.SaveToFile(fileName);
		</div>
	</p>
