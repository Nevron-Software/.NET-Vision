The example demonstrates the ability to organize document content in layers. 
Layers are the primary content holders and are used to group relatated content. 
All nodes in a layer share the same Z Order relative to nodes in other layers. 
Layers can also be used to provide nodes with default styles, thus enabling you to define a default 
appearance for all nodes in a layer.
<p>
The example also demonstrates the ability to specify the level on which shadows are cast. 
You can easily see the effect of the different Shadow Z-Order settings by experimenting with the Shadows Z Order group.

Note that the designer is also aware of which the default layer is and is by default designed to 
manipulate its content only. In this way you can focus on the editing of the current active layer content.
</p>
<p>
In this example there are three layers - one for the tree, one for the elliptical grid graph and one for the two blue shapes.
You can change their order with the help of the Predefined Z Order combo.

<p>
The Select Active Layer combo is used to change the currently active layer. 
When you change it all content from the default layer will be selected. 
The layer content itself does not hold local styles so changing the layer styles will have an effect on all layer children.
