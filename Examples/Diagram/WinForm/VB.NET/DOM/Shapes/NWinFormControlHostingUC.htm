This example demonstrates the Win Form Control hosting shape. It allows you to embed any WinForm control inside a drawing document.
</p>
<p>
A WinForm control hosting shape is created by specifying a valid WinForm control in its constructor. 
The inplace editing of a WinForm control hosting shape is achieved by a host control, which is instanced in the drawing view.
</p>
<p>
A WinForm control host shape can be instructed to deactivate itself if it looses focus or not via its DeactiveOnLostFocus property (by default set to true).
In this example all controls are activated by default and are not deactivated when they loose focus.
</p>
<p>
WinForm controls do not support serialization (e.g. there is no way to save/load a WinForm control).
However WinForm controls have basic support for designer serialization (which is used in Visual Studio for example). 
The WinForm control host shape exploits the design time serialization capabilties of controls to save and load them.
