		This example demonstrates the support for text box shapes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Text boxes can display the text either in wrapped or stretched mode. Text boxes use the 
		Nevron Graphics support for texts, which allows you to apply fill style and and backplane style to the displayed text.
		A strong feature of the texts is that they support XML formatting, which allows you to mix the fonts, sizes and fill effects 
		of the text in a single text box.

	<p>
		Texts can be inplace edited - just double click on the text box to show the inplace editor.
