		This example demonstrates the shape translation slaves.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is in many cases necessary to implement rigid connected shapes structures. 
		In Nevron Diagram for .NET this is achieved with the help of shape translation slaves. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The translation slaves of a shape are such shapes, which are translated with the shape when it is translated.
		The accumulation of the shape translation slaves is recursive. For example: if a shape  
		has to be translated, because it is a translation slave, then its translation slaves will also be translated.
	</p> 
	<p>
		To explore translation slaves behavior just select a shape in the diagram and check the shapes, which must be 
		translated when it is translated. Then move the shape. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that the example will automatically highlight the translation slaves of the currently selected shape.
