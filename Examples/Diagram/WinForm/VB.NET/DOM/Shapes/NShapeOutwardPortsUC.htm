		This example demonstrates shape outward ports.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Besides the ability to anchor its location to a specific aspect of the shape to which it belongs,
	    each port has the option to choose its type in regards to what and how can be connected to it. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    According to this classification, each port can be of the following type:
	    <ul>
	     	<li><b>Inward</b>
	     	- this is the default port type. Plugs and outward ports can be connected to inward ports.
			</li>
			<li><b>Outward</b>
	     	- this type of port does not allow plugs to be connected to it. An outward port however can be connected 
	     	to an inward port. When connected, the outward port controls the location and orientation of the shape 
	     	to which it belongs. It will automatically rotate and translate the shape according to the following two                 rules:
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        <ol>
	            <li>The shape is translated so that the outward port location becomes the current inward port                   location</li>
	            <li>The shape is rotated so that the outward port direction matches the inward port direction                            </li>
	        </ol>  	
			</li>
			<li><b>Inward and Outward</b>
	     	- this is a mixure of the above mentioned modes.
			</li>
	    </ul>
	    In this example the red shape has a single outward port - move it to close to another shape to experience outward        port snapping and connections.
	</p>
	<p>
	    In an inward-outward port connection both ports provide direction angles. 
	    The two direction angles are matched to determine the final angle to which the shape with the outward port must          be rotated.
