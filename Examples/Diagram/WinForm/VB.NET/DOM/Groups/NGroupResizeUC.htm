		This example demonstrates the different modes in which shapes can be resized in 
		groups.
	</p>
	<p>
		When shapes reside in groups you can control the mode in which they are resized 
		when the group is resized. This is specified by the ResizeInAggregate property. 
		If the value of this property is set to UseAggregateSettings the shape will be 
		resized in accordance with the group ResizeAggregatedModels property.
	</p>
	<p>
		The resize modes are a function of two parameters - the type of scaling, which 
		must be applied to the shape and whether it must be repositioned after scaling.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Scale type</b> refers to the way in which the shape must be scaled. In 
		general there are four scale types:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Affine scale</b>
			- in affine scaling the group will alter the shape local transformation (i.e. 
			the shape will be transformed). Affine scaling can be applied in both the X and 
			Y group resize direction. If the shape is rotated this can skew the shape in 
			the scale direction.
			<li>
				<b>Cartesian scale</b>
			- in cartesian scaling the group will proportionally scale the shape in its X 
			and Y resize direction. (i.e. the shape will preserve its orthogonality).
			<li>
				<b>Scale 1D</b>
			- in 1D scaling the group will scale only the start and end points of the 
			shape.
			<li>
				<b>No scale</b> - the shape will not be scaled.
			</li>
		</ul>
	<P></P>
	<p>
		<b>Reposition</b> refers to the abilitiy to specify whether the shape pin point 
		must preserve its location relative to the resized group model bounds (i.e. 
		whether the shape must be "pinned" to its relative location in group).
	</p>
	<p>
		Examples:
		<p>
			<b>ResizeInAggregate.CartesianScaleAndReposition</b> means apply cartesian 
			scale to the shape and preserve its pin point relative to the group bounds.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>ResizeInAggregate.AffineScaleXRepositionY</b> means apply affine scale to 
			the shape in the X direction and preserve its pin point Y position relative to 
			the group bounds.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>ResizeInAggregate.RepositionOnly</b> means apply do not scale the the shape, 
			but preserve its pin point relative to the group bounds.
		</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		To exlore the resize in aggregate behavior just resize any of the four groups in this example. 
		For the better demonstration of reposition the pin point of most of the shapes is set to the bottom 
		right corner of the group to which they belong.
