		This example demonstrates the built in support for representing connected shapes structures as graphs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Graphs are built from two types of objects - vertices and edges. In Nevron Diagram for .NET graph vertices and 
		graph edges are called <b>graph parts</b>. Each graph part is used to represent a single shape from the diagram. 
	</p>
	<p>
		2D shapes are by default treated as vertices, while 1D shapes are treated as edges. 
		You can however specify whether a shape should at all be considered as a graph part with the help of the GraphPart property
		of every shape.
	</p>
	<p>
		To explore graph navigation, check the graph parts which must be highlighted when a shape has been selected and 
		then just click on any of the shapes in the diagram to see the respective objects highlighted. 
		The <b>Graph part</b> check lets you specify whether the currently selected shape should at all be treated as a graph part.
