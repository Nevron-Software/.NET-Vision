        <b>Nevron Diagram</b> makes it easy to import geographical data from Esri shapefiles. You
        can import the shapes in separate layers and control the way they are rendered applying
        various styles to them. Also additional information is provided for each shape
        (such as Country Name, Area, Population, Currency, etc.). When rendering the map, the 3D
        geographical data must be projected on the plane to produce the 2D map. You can choose from
        the following projections:

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Aitoff</b> - Proposed by David A. Aitoff in 1889, it is the equatorial form of the
                azimuthal equidistant projection, but stretched into a 2:1 ellipse while halving the
                longitude from the central meridian.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Bonne</b> - a pseudoconical equal-area map projection. All parallels are standard,
                with the same scale as the central meridian; parallels are concentric circles. No
                distortion along the reference parallel or the central meridian.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cylindrical Equal-Area</b> - represents a cylindrical equal-area projection of the
                Earth. The following is a summary of cylindrical equal-area projection's special cases:
                <ul>
                    <li>Lambert - standard parallel of 0 degrees</li>
                    <li>Behrmann - standard parallel of 30 degrees</li>
                    <li>Tristan Edwards - standard parallel of 37.383 degrees</li>
                    <li>Peters - standard parallel of 44.138 degrees</li>
                    <li>Gall - standard parallel of 45 degrees</li>
                    <li>Balthasart - standard parallel of 50 degrees</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Eckert IV</b> - pseudocylindrical and equal area projection. The central meridian
                is straight, the 180th meridians are semi-circles, other meridians are elliptical.
                Scale is true along the parallel at 40:30 North and South.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Eckert VI</b> - pseudocylindrical and equal area projection. The central meridian and
                all parallels are at right angles, all other meridians are sinusoidal curves. Shape
                distortion increases at the poles. Scale is correct at standard parallels of 49:16 North
                and South.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Equirectangular</b> - projection that maps meridians to equally spaced vertical
                straight lines, and parallels to equally spaced horizontal straight lines.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Hammer</b> - an equal-area map projection, described by Ernst Hammer in 1892.
                Visually, the Aitoff and Hammer projections are very similar, but the Hammer has seen
                more use because of its equal-area property.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Kavrayskiy VII</b> - a map projection invented by V. V. Kavrayskiy in 1939 for use
                 as a general purpose pseudocylindrical projection. It has been used in the former Soviet
                 Union but is almost unknown in the Western world.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mercator</b> - introduced in 1569 by Gerardus Mercator. 
                It is often described as a cylindrical projection, but it must be derived
                mathematically. The meridians are equally spaced, parallel vertical lines, 
                and the parallels of latitude are parallel, horizontal straight lines, 
                spaced farther and farther apart as their distance from the Equator 
                increases.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Miller Cylindrical</b> - a modified Mercator projection, proposed by Osborn
                Maitland Miller (1897-1979) in 1942. The parallels of latitude are scaled by a
                factor of 0.8, projected according to Mercator, and then the result is divided
                by 0.8 to retain scale along the equator.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mollweide</b> - a pseudocylindrical map projection generally used for global 
                maps of the world (or sky). Also known as the Babinet projection, homolographic
                projection, or elliptical projection. It sacrifices fidelity to angle and shape in
                favor of accurate depiction of area.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Orthographic</b> - a perspective (or azimuthal) projection, in which the sphere
                is projected onto a tangent plane. It depicts a hemisphere of the globe as it appears from
                outer space. The shapes and areas are distorted, particularly near the edges, but distances
                are preserved along parallels.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Robinson</b> - made in 1988 to show the entire world at once.
                It was specifically created in an attempt to find the good compromise to the problem of
                readily showing the whole globe as a flat image. The projection is neither equal-area
                nor conformal, abandoning both for a compromise.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Stereographic</b> - it is a particular mapping (function) that projects a sphere onto
                a plane. In general, area-preserving map projections are preferred for statistical applications,
                because they behave well with respect to integration, while angle-preserving (conformal) map
                projections are preferred for navigation. The stereographic projection falls into the second category.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Van der Grinten</b> - neither equal-area nor conformal projection. It projects 
                the entire Earth into a circle, though the polar regions are subject to extreme distortion.
                The projection offers pleasant balance of shape and scale distortion. Boundary is a circle;
                all parallels and meridians are circular arcs (spacing of parallels is arbitrary). No 
                distortion along the standard parallel at the equator.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Wagner VI</b> - a pseudocylindrical whole Earth map projection. Like the Robinson projection,
                 it is a compromise projection, not having any special attributes other than a pleasing, low
                 distortion appearance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Winkel Tripel</b> - a modified azimuthal map projection proposed by Oswald Winkel
                in 1921. The projection is the arithmetic mean of the equirectangular projection and
                the Aitoff projection. Goldberg & Gott show that the Winkel Tripel is arguably the best
                overall whole-earth map projection known, producing very small distance errors, small
                combinations of ellipticity and area errors, and the smallest skewness of any map. In
                1998, the Winkel Tripel projection replaced the Robinson projection as the standard
                projection for world maps made by the National Geographic Society.

	    You can play with the example zooming the map in and out using the scrollbar or clicking the scrollbar
	    and using the mouse wheel afterwards. You can also see the available data for the shapes and change
	    the used projection from the combo box. While you move the cursor over the map, the cursor position
	    in longitude and lattitude is also shown. The <b>InvertPoint</b> method of the projection is used to calculate
	    the longitude an lattitude values from the current screen coordinates. Note that the Winkel Tripel
	    projection does not support this method.
