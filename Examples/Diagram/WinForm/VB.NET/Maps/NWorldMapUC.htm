        <b>Nevron Diagram</b> makes it easy to import geographical data from Esri shapefiles. You
        can import the shapes in separate layers and control the way they are rendered applying
        various styles to them. Also additional information is provided for each shape
        (such as Country Name, Area, Population, Currency, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
        To import maps in you diagrams just follow these simple steps:
    </p>    
    <p>        
        <ol>
            <li>
                Create an object of type <b>NEsriMap</b> that will host the geographical data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the Esri shapefiles you want to load one by one using the <b>Add</b> method
                of the map. The Add method returns the created shapefile in case you want
                to set some of its properties:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>EnableZoomInRange</b> - Gets/sets whether the objects from the file should only 
                        be shown if the current zoom factor is in the Min/Max Zoom factor range specified 
                        by the <b>MinShowZoomFactor</b> and <b>MaxShowZoomFactor</b> properties.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>NameColumn</b> - Determines the data column from the DBF file to use for naming 
                        of the diagram elements that are created from this shapefile.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                When finished adding shapefiles to the map, call the <b>Read</b> method to load the data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Call the <b>ImportShapes</b> method to import the loaded shapes in the document.
                You can control the importing process using the ShapeImporter of the map that has
                the following properties:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>PolygonsAsShapes, PolylinesAsShapes</b> - determine whether to render the objects as shapes or as paths.</li>
                    <li><b>ImportInMultipleLayers</b> - determines whether to import the data from each Esri file into separate layer.</li>
                    <li><b>ShapeCreatedListener</b> - if you want to perform additional customization on each diagram element
                        implement the <b>INShapeCreatedListener</b> interface and set it to this property.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	    You can play with the example zooming the map in and out using the scrollbar or clicking the scrollbar
	    and using the mouse wheel afterwards. You can also see the available data for the shapes or navigate
	    to a city of your choice.
