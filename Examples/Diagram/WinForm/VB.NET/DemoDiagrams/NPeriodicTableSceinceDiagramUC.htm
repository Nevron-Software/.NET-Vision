	<P>
	The example demonstrates how to use the Nevron Diagram for .NET to display complex scientific diagrams. 
	This example uses the following features:
	<p>
		1. Grouping - in this example the elements legend is a group. Groups are shapes 
		composed from other shapes.
	</p>
	<p>
		2. Background frame - in this example we have demonstrated the powerful support 
		for background image frames. Image frames are predefined vector based graphics, 
		which greatly contribute for the visual impact of your diagrams. In this 
		example the image frame has a gradient fill style and gausian blur shadow, 
		which blends with the designer window back color.
	</p>
	<p>
		3. Speed - this is a nice example for the speed of our component and 
		demonstrates that it can really handle large amount of complex shapes. Please 
		note that in this example we use XML formatted texts also, which are harder and 
		more time consuming to display, but nevertheless the diagram remains fully 
		interactive.
