		This example demonstrates the basic drawing view features, which are:
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Panning</b>. Panning is the the ability to control the viewport origin. The 
		viewport origin is the first point in document scene coordinates, which is 
		displayed by the view. The viewport origin is mapped to the window origin, 
		which is the first point in view client coordinates which displays document 
		content.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Global visibility</b> gives you control over the global visibility of 
		particular elements, decorations and effects.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Document padding</b> lets you apply a padding to the document bounds. The 
		total viewport size is calculated by inflating the document bounds with the 
		document padding.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Document shadow</b>. The view provides you with the ability to display a 
		decoration shadow behind the document bounds.
	</p>
	</p>
		<b>Scaling and zooming</b>. The view provides you with a natural way to apply X and Y scaling 
		of the document. In case the X and Y scales are equal the effect of scaling is called zooming.
	<p>
	<p>
		<b>View layout</b>. The component support for different types of view layouts:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Normal</i>
			- the user can freely modify the viewport origin and scale parameters of the 
			view (pan and zoom the view)
			<li>
				<i>Fit</i>
			- the viewport origin and scales are automatically calculated, so that the 
			document fits in the view window with preserved aspect ratio.
			<li>
				<i>Stretch</i>
			- the viewport origin and scales are automatically calculated, so that the 
			document stretches to fill the window. This setting can break the aspect ratio 
			of the document (scale it irregularly).
			<li>
				<i>Stretch to Width</i>
			- the viewport origin X and scales are automatically calculated, so that the 
			document stretches to fit the window width. This setting preserves the document 
			aspect ratio.
			<li>
				<i>Stretch to Height</i> - the viewport origin Y and scales are automatically 
				calculated, so that the document stretches to fit the window height. This 
				setting preserves the document aspect ratio.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
	<p>
		<b>Scrolling and autoscrolling</b>. The view exposes control over different 
		aspects of scrolling and autoscrolling, such as:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Scrollbars visibility
			</li>
			<li>
				Alignment of the document relative to the view, when no scrollbars should be 
				displayed
			</li>
			<li>
				Small scroll step (defined in pixels)
			</li>
			<li>
				Delay for autoscrolling (specified in milliseconds)
			</li>
			<li>
				Time between two autoscroll steps (specified in milliseconds)
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
