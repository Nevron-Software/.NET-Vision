		This example demonstrates the view messages, which appear when certain 
		operations cannot be completed or commited. This is in most cases caused when 
		the elements to which you try to apply a certain action do not have the 
		appropriate permission or some other properties of the object prohibit this 
		action from being executed.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this example the red shape does not have a <b>Change Style</b> permission. 
		To explore the behavior of the component when transactions cannot be completed 
		do the following:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Select the green and the red shapes
			<li>
				Right click on the red or green shape to show a context sensitive menu
			<li>
				Go to Format - Fill style... and click on it - this will show the fill style editor.
			<li>
				Select a fill style and click the OK button
			</li>
		</ol>
		Only the green shape will change its appearance and a designer message 
		will pop up indicating that the transaction was not completed. Note that not 
		completed transaction are still committed - e.g. not completed means that only 
		parts of the transaction failed. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of the methods, which record transactions accept an additonal 
		rollbackOnFail argument, which indicates whether the entire transaction should 
		fail, if only a part of it failed.
