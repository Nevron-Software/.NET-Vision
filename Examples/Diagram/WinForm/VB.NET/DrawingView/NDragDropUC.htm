		This example demonstrates the ability to drag and drop single or multiple shapes between drawing views.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this example we have created an additional drawing view hosting a second 
		drawing document. They are located in the Example form and the additional 
		document has blue background color. The view of the blue document has a Move 
		Tool enabled. This is also valid for the default view, the document of which 
		has green background color.
	</p>
	<p>
		Initially the move tool of the blue view is configured to perform only drag and 
		drop. If you drag a shape and release it in the blue view nothing will happen, 
		since the tool will only create a ghost for the drag and drop operation and 
		will not perform any translation. To perform drag and drop just drag and drop a 
		shape from the blue view in the green view. While doing this you can press the 
		Ctrl key to copy the shape. If the Ctrl key is not pressed the shape will be 
		moved.
	</p>
	<p>
		Initially the move tool of the green view is configured to only translate 
		content. If you have dropped a shape from the blue view to the green view 
		you will not be able to return it in the blue view.
	</p>
	<p>
		To do so you have to modify the green view to support Drag and Drop - you 
		do so from the <b>Green view move mode combo</b>. The later is also valid 
		for the blue view, the move mode for which is controlled by the <b>Blue view move mode combo</b>
