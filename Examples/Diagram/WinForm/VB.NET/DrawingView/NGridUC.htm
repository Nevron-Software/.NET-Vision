		This example demonstrates the view grid. The grid is one of the useful view components, which can help 
		you better align and arrange diagram elements. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The point from which all grid lines originate is called grid origin. In this example the grid origin is controlled by the 
		<b>OriginX</b> and <b>OriginY</b> numeric up downs. You can also easily control the grid visibility 
		and the visibility of the origin itsleft.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the most important grid features is that its measurement unit can be different from the document measurement unit.
	</p>
	<p>
		The grid can be displayed in several modes. The currently supported modes are: MajorLines, MajorDots, 
		MajorMinorLines, Interlaced, InterlacedHorizontally and InterlacedVertically. In this example the <b>Grid Style combo</b> 
		controls the current appearance style of the grid.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cell size of the grid can also be determined in several modes. These are:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Normal</i> - in this mode the grid autmatically chooses a grid cell size, which takes into account the current zoom factor
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Fine</i> - this mode uses a grid cell size, which is twice smaller than the normal grid cell size
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Coarse</i> - this mode uses a grid cell size, which is twice bigger than the normal grid cell size
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Fixed</i> - in this mode the user specifies the grid cell size, which remains fixed and is not dependant on the zoom factor.
			</li>
		</ul>
