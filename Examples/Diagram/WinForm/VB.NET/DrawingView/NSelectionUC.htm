		This example demonstrates the selection. The selection is an attribute of the 
		view and is used to define the current set of manipulated nodes. The selection 
		can operate in three modes:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>Disabled</i> - in this mode no nodes can be selected and the selection is 
				empty
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Single</i> - in this mode only a single node can be selected
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>Multiple</i> - in this multiple nodes can be selected
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		In this example you can change the selection mode from the <b>Selection Mode combo</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Many align and resize operation require to have an anchor (or master) node. For 
		example the align lefts commands aligns the lefts of the selected nodes to the 
		left side of the anchor node. When multiple nodes are selected the selection 
		anchor handles have inverted colors. Different applications use either the 
		first or the last selected node as selection anchor, so we have provided this 
		as an option.
